The company has met important operational benchmarks over the last year including profitability and also the pilot success of its new ventures like home interiors, property management and rentals among others. He added that Square Yards is now at the cusp of accelerating further growth while adding that with a stronger institutional partner such as ADM Capital, the company can push forward aggressively towards accomplishing both personal and brand investments with a view towards ensuring a swifter growth trajectory.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Square Yards is already developing an integrated service ecosystem both inorganically and organically.
