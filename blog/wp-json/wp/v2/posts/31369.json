Vastu Shastra is regarded as the science of designing and building houses, offices, temples, and other living spaces. Since ancient times, energy has been considered a free-flowing creation that can neither be created nor destroyed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">&nbsp;The transformation from one form to the other is possible. This free-flowing energy directs all the positive or negative vibes and thoughts within ourselves and our surroundings. Following the sets of rules and regulations of Vastu before entering any new place is mandatory to live a healthy and peaceful life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Referring to our auspicious Mythology and Vedas, Vastu Shastra indicates the directions- East and North to be most blessed with positive energies; hence, North-facing homes are the most auspicious ones.<strong> Vastu Shastra for North Facing Homes <\/strong>is widely accepted because of the presence of Lord Kuber, also known as the God of Wealth, in the North direction. It is not only the north-facing home that brings in prosperity but the whole North-facing house planin which every direction should be planned as per the Vastu. North Facing Home Vastu includes a complete list of directions for different corners of the house that needs to be followed to attract good positive energies. The list is as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Master Bedroom:<\/strong> Should face South-west region<\/li><li><strong>Pooja Room:<\/strong> Should be located in North-east region<\/li><li><strong>Living Room:<\/strong> Should face North-east region<\/li><li><strong>Guest Room:<\/strong> Should be in the North-west region<\/li><li><strong>Kitchen:<\/strong> Should lie in the South-east or North-west direction.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-about-north-facing-home\"><strong>About North Facing Home<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Briefly describing since the existence of humans, directions have played an essential role in assisting where, what and when to hunt, hide and migrate. Era&#8217;s changed, but directions still play a significant role in defining wealth and prosperity in human life; hence, the main entry gate of any house situated in the north direction is considered as North Facing Home that accounts for most positive energies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-are-north-facing-homes-good-or-bad\"><strong>Are North Facing Homes Good or Bad?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">It would not be fitting to conclude that only <strong>North Facing House Plans<\/strong> are the most appropriate and good ones, and the rest of the directions are not; rather, all the directions have their specialty, no direction is good or bad. People need to follow specific guidelines of <strong>Vastu Shastra for North Facing Homes <\/strong>to attract prosperity to their homes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-location-of-main-gate-in-north-facing-house-plan\"><strong>Location of Main Gate in North Facing House Plan<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">In any house plan, there is always a special emphasis on the location of the main gate because it is the entrance point of the home from where either all negative or all the positive forces will enter the home. Hence its placement is the major area of concern. So, in a<strong> North Facing House Plan<\/strong>, the main gate should only be located in the North direction, the distance between north-east and north-west is divided into nine equal parts, where also the fifth step is the most auspicious among all because of the belief of the existence of God of Wealth there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><span style=\"background-color:#0693e3\" class=\"has-inline-background\">9<\/span><\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><span style=\"background-color:#0693e3\" class=\"has-inline-background\">8<\/span><\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><span style=\"background-color:#0693e3\" class=\"has-inline-background\">7<\/span><\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><span style=\"background-color:#0693e3\" class=\"has-inline-background\">6<\/span><\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><span style=\"background-color:#0bf90d\" class=\"has-inline-background\">5<\/span><\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><span style=\"background-color:#fef208\" class=\"has-inline-background\">4<\/span><\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><span style=\"background-color:#fef208\" class=\"has-inline-background\">3<\/span><\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><span style=\"background-color:#fef208\" class=\"has-inline-background\">2<\/span><\/td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><span style=\"background-color:#fef208\" class=\"has-inline-background\">1<\/span><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><figcaption>\u2191 Towards North<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-importance-of-padas-in-vastu-shastra\"><strong>Importance of Padas in Vastu Shastra<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">According to the Vastu Shastra, a north-facing home is the most auspicious location as no pada situated in this direction is considered inauspicious. But to attract prosperity and well-being of the family members, people should follow the following tips:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">As stated above, the fifth pada is considered the most auspicious among all the nine padas because of the presence of the Lord of wealth Kuber and determines the entrance of all the flow of energy in the house. Therefore, the main gate should always be placed in the fifth pada to attract wealth and prosperity to your home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-is-there-any-alternative-for-placing-the-main-door-at-the-fifth-pada\"><strong>Is there any alternative for placing the main door at the fifth pada?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">In Vastu Shastra, it is advised that if due to any circumstances like size issue or anything else, the individual cannot place the main gate at fifth pada, then they may utilize first to the fourth pada particularly, and should not leave the fifth one. In some cases, if there is no choice to place the main door from first to the fifth pada, people may use sixth to the ninth pada to place the door.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Caution: <\/strong>It is advised that, due to the unavailability of any other pada for placement of the door, any individual tends to place the door at the fifth pada, they are advised to leave some space from the north-east corner.

When things are placed according to the Vastu, good vibes, energy, and health are attracted, and if not, then many unimaginable, bad things do happen. So, one must always consult Vastu before buying any property and after shifting to a new property. According to Vastu Shastra, no direction is good or bad. Still, a north-facing property is considered most auspicious due to the belief of Lord Kuber. For any doshas, in the rest of the directions, many Vastu doshas tips are also there that help to attract positive energies in non-north-facing properties too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2
