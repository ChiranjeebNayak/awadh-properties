Vastu experts tell us how to take advantage of the power of west-facing homes to make them more profitable for homeowners. Home purchasers may make unusual decisions to bring prosperity and positive energy into their homes. Some people, for instance, may only desire an east-facing residence, north-facing bedrooms, or perhaps an east-facing kid&#8217;s room.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">In truth, west-facing residences are less desirable due to a prevalent misunderstanding that they are unfortunate and inauspicious. According to experts of Vastu Shastra for west-facing homes, all angles are equal yet come with specific restrictions that one should be aware of for positivity to flow freely in the home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Even if a lovely west-facing house is available, numerous real estate brokers or lucrative property advertising will try to persuade you to buy other properties. They frequently advertise such homes at a significantly higher price, claiming that they are in high demand. It is fairly unusual for people to believe and propagate rumours that a west-facing home brings bad luck and should be avoided. On the flip side, the reality is quite different than it actually is. Nevertheless, Square Yards is here to burst these misconceptions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">According to Indian Vastu gurus, each direction has its meaning and is equally fortunate. So, ensure that the property is Vastu compliant. It will help you and your family have a happy and wealthy life ahead. Today, we will dig deep into the significance of the Vastu designs for west-facing homes. So, stay connected with us as we investigate why you should not dismiss a magnificent west-facing house just based on misconceptions and rumours. So, let&#8217;s get started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-is-a-west-facing-house\">What is a West-facing house?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">A residence or apartment is termed west-facing if the main entrance faces west. Normally, west-facing residences are not considered auspicious, but Vastu experts disagree. West-facing residences&#8217; main entrances should be somewhat to the north-west or in the center. When it comes to the main door, the southwest approach should be avoided at all costs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The 5th and 6th pada will be the finest for the main door if you split the lengths from the northwest angle to the west corner into nine equal sections or pada, with the first in one in the west and the ninth one in the southwest. The seventh, eighth, as well as ninth padas should not be used for the entry since they are regarded as the devil&#8217;s energy corner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Nevertheless, as per Vastu Shastra, all dwellings are regarded equally auspicious. Therefore west-facing homes are no less fortunate than north or east-facing ones. If certain Vastu Shastra principles are followed, a west-facing home can be as wealthy as other dwellings. In this blog, we will look at the benefits of choosing a west-facing apartment as well as the Vastu principles to follow while building a west-facing home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">According to the real convictions of the intellectual movement of Vastu Shastra, all dwellings, whether they are north, east, west, as well as south-facing, are regarded equally fortunate if they are built according to Vastu Shastra design concepts. According to Vastu Shastra, the orientation of the dwelling has no bearing. It all depends on where the house&#8217;s primary entrance or door is located.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-is-there-any-benefit\">Is there any benefit?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Homes with west-facing doors, however, according to Japanese house design principles, exude youth and enthusiasm. West-facing doors are said to let more energy into the dwelling. As a result, all traditional Geisha residences in Japan have their main entrance facing west. Folks who reside in west-facing residences are seen to be affluent and have a large social circle. They will have no adversaries and will be adored by everyone at work, relationships, and social contexts. Lawmakers, teachers, religious figures, and entrepreneurs benefit from living in residences with a west-facing orientation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The kids&#8217; room in a west-facing house might be located on the south or western side, while the guest room can be located on the northwest. However, according to Vastu, the pooja room and sitting room should be at the northeast quadrant of the home, as it is the most fortunate corner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The main bedroom should be oriented to the southwest. Your master bedroom must be on the upper floor of a multi-level home. Choose the east side for your kitchen. According to Vastu, the kitchen must not be placed immediately under or above the pooja room, bedrooms, or toilet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The main benefit of a west-facing home is that you can enjoy the brightness and brilliance of the setting sun until dusk. Some people believe that a home facing the west will bring them more prosperity and fortune. They will have no adversaries and will be popular at work and also in social situations. Politicians, business entrepreneurs, teachers, and spiritual figures are said to prefer residences with a west-facing orientation. It is also said to be beneficial to children since it provides them with energy and happiness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">You may have noticed that having a house that faces west or north is unattractive or brings bad omen, and so on. But much like any other property, you may employ Vastu principles to make a west-facing house fortunate. The west is not considered an unfavourable direction in Vastu Shastra. In fact, according to Vastu Shastra, any orientation is excellent for a home. However, the position of the entry or main door is the determining element in Vastu for your property.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">There is a popular misconception that west-facing dwellings are Vastu-defying, but this isn&#8217;t true. West-facing houses rank below north-and east-facing buildings in terms of auspiciousness, but they are not unlucky. In fact, Vastu principles claim that the West-facing homes offer profits and financial and non-financial advantages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-vastu-tips-for-your-west-facing-house\">Vastu Tips for your West-facing House<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>As per Vastu Shastra, it is critical for homeowners developing or purchasing new homes to establish a clear door situated within the appropriate &#8216;padas&#8217; or steps. The number of padas is calculated by dividing the house into nine equal sections, starting at the northwest corner, and working southward. In west-facing residences, the fourth, third, fifth, and sixth padas are the most auspicious for main entrances because they bring optimism and pleasant feelings. If the earlier in this thread padas are unavailable, the main door might be placed on padas one and two, which are neither excellent nor bad.<\/li><li>The kitchen is the main house engine and a source of good health and happiness for everyone who lives there. Therefore, Vastu adherents must construct their kitchens in the proper orientation. The kitchen should be in the eastern part or southeast part of the home, according to Vastu shastra. It is claimed that doing so guarantees that a kitchen&#8217;s positive charm is at its peak.<\/li><li>According to Vastu principles, the master bedroom should be in the house&#8217;s southern part. As a result, if the property has more than one story, the master bedroom should preferably be on the top floor. For bedrooms, there is a greater variety of direction options. As a result, they can be placed on the building&#8217;s south, west, or western most sides. It is preferable to have your master bedroom on the southwest side of the house. This orientation helps in increasing communication between couples in the room. If you have a multi-story home, the master bedroom should be on the top floor. This would bring prosperity, peace, and ancestral benefits to your household.<\/li><li>According to Vastu principles, private pools, storage tanks, and water submersible pumps should not be erected towards the west. Open areas should be located on the Eastern side of the building, away from the Western direction.<\/li><li>Colors like white, silvery, yellowish, and beige are most suited for west-facing houses, as per Vastu principles. Furthermore, it is claimed that these colours increase earnings and benefits from the Western direction. On the other hand, the home is oriented more towards the West than other directions, a lighter shade of blue can be employed to take advantage of the direction&#8217;s advantages. Off-white as well as creams are Vastu-neutral colors, making them safe choices when faced with a color palette.<\/li><li>Make sure your primary door entry is in the Midwest or Northwest corner of your house. Metalwork, such as a metallic name board or a metallic bell should be designed for your west-facing entrance. Maintain a detritus main entry area. Remove any trash cans or damaged furniture from the area around the entrance door.<\/li><li>The first and best step is to establish whether you have a property that faces west. Determining the same might be difficult because many people believe that the setting sun is in the west. The precise west direction, on the other hand, fluctuates year to year. You can establish the precise west side in only two days every year.<\/li><li>The temple, also known as a pooja room, is a sacred space where you may harness all of the divine forces surrounding you. The northeast direction is the most energetic zone in a west-facing home; therefore, it makes complete sense to put it in this corner. However, not every home has the necessary space to have a separate pooja room. If your lounge room does not have enough space for this, you can position your living room inside the north and a tiny temple or pooja stand inside the north part.<\/li><li>While verifying the directional face of the property, use a magnetic compass to trace the precise west.<\/li><li>Make sure the current house&#8217;s main entrance is only in the third or fourth padas.<\/li><li>Build the walls mainly on the south and west sides of the building- a bit thicker and taller than those on the east and north sides.<\/li><li>Place your living room as well as the Pooja room at the northeast corner of the house, as this is the most auspicious part of the house.<\/li><li>If you don&#8217;t have a pooja room, install the temple inside the living room&#8217;s north part.<\/li><li>Make sure the kid&#8217;s room is facing either west, south, or north-west.<\/li><li>If your plot is slanted, ensure that it is slanted from south to north.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-things-you-must-avoid\">Things you must avoid<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Avoid using the setting sun to discover the precise west direction.<\/li><li>Except for the ones listed, avoid all other padas unless you visit a Vastu specialist beforehand.<\/li><li>Avoid buying land with a north-to-south slope since it may result in financial losses.<\/li><li>Avoid buying a parcel of land or a house with a southwest or south direction expansion.<\/li><li>A bore well, a storage tank or a sump should not be located in the southwest corner of a west-facing residence.<\/li><li>A kitchen should not be placed in the house&#8217;s southwest corner.<\/li><li>Sleeping beneath a beam or a wall divider is not a good idea.<\/li><li>Make sure your legs aren&#8217;t pointed towards the bedroom door as you sleep.<\/li><li>Purchase a property with a South and West border that is thinner than the East and North boundaries.<\/li><li>Avoid any home with the main entrance blocked by a huge item such as a tree or an electric pole.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-conclusion\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">As can be seen, the Vastu of west facing property is just as excellent as any other Vastu. All you have to do now is make sure you follow all of the Vastu regulations. If you are building a house on a plot, it is rather simple. However, if you are moving to a flat or apartment, you may face several difficulties. It is frequently impossible to carry out a remodel that necessitates structural changes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-you-might-also-like\">You Might Also Like<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-yoast-seo-related-links\"><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.squareyards.com\/blog\/south-facing-house-vastu-plans\">How to Improve Vastu for a South-facing Home?<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.squareyards.com\/blog\/vastu-for-flats\">Vastu for Flats &amp; Apartments: 15 Major signs to watch out for<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.squareyards.com\/blog\/north-facing-house-vastu-plan\">North Facing House Vastu Plan for a Peaceful Life<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.squareyards.com\/blog\/west-facing-house-vastu-plan-tips\">West Facing House Vastu Plan &amp; Tips<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.squareyards.com\/blog\/west-facing-house-vastu-plans\">West Facing House Vastu Plan<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-frequently-asked-questions-faqs\">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)<\/h2>\n\n\n        <section class=\"sc_fs_faq sc_card\">\n            <div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Where is the sun from a west-facing house?<\/h2>                <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom mid-evening to sunset, west-facing residences receive sunshine.
