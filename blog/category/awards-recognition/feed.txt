<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: 400">Post the successful inaugural edition of India’s Growth Champions, ET has now collaborated once again with Statista for the second edition. The annual ranking highlights the fastest growing Indian companies in all key industries by way of revenues. Participating entities share their revenue details for financial years 2016/17 and 2019/20 along with added data. Companies should have churned out minimum revenue figures for a period of 3 years for being eligible to register and apply. They should be independent entities while majorly showcasing organic growth. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: 400">Taking the present global economic slowdown into consideration, it is vital to acknowledge the contribution of these exceptional companies as examples of what can still be achieved amidst adversity.

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: 400">Several leading companies have made it to the list including the likes of Wakefit, Razorpay, upGrad, InstaSafe, Kinara Capital, Zomato, Welspun Enterprises, Paytm, SaaS Labs, Mahindra First Choice, Jubilant FoodWorks, Radico Khaitan and Indiabulls Ventures among numerous other trailblazers. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: 400">Square Yards has achieved the 37</span><span style="font-weight: 400">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> rank in the 2021 edition and is a trailblazer in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Property</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> category.

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: 400">The massive accomplishment was acknowledged and celebrated by the company and its fast-growing legion of employees worldwide. CEO and Founder <a href="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/tag/mr-tanuj-shori" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tanuj Shori</a> summed it up when he posted about being </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">super proud to be amongst the fastest growing Indian companies, yet again</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.

<p class="has-drop-cap">At its 12<sup>th</sup> Realty+ Conclave &amp; Excellence Awards, PUNE: A Virtual Series, Realty+ awarded Square Yards under the category ‘Digital Marketing Campaign of the Year’ for the tremendous performance we showcased under ‘The Lockdown Phenomenon’ campaign.</p>



<p>Crafted with passion, precision, and perseverance, Real Estate digital campaigns run by Square Yards during the lockdown are earning us accolades, appreciation, and rewards.</p>



<p>In the 12<sup>th</sup> Realty+ Conclave &amp; Excellence Awards, PUNE: A Virtual Series, Square Yards was nominated &#8211; and got awarded &#8211; under the category ‘Digital Marketing Campaign of the Year’ for the tremendous performance showcased under the campaign named ‘The Lockdown Phenomenon’.</p>



<p>The yearly edition of Realty+ Excellence Awards by Realty+, an exchange4media &amp; BW BusinessWorld Group publication, recognizes and rewards excellence in Real Estate sector under various categories. The Excellence Awards have earned a reputation for being the standard for innovation and achievement in real estate for the winners. These awards serve as a tribute to their outstanding performance across numerous real estate categories.</p>



<p>The campaign by Square Yards resulted in 3700+ transactions valued at Rs 2200 Crore and helped Square Yards gain almost 20% market share during the period for which the campaign was run. Timing of the innovative digital campaign made it an instant hit as people were looking for ways to overcome the unprecedented times. The major highlight of the campaign was the end-to-end online buying cycle facilitated by Square Yards.</p>



<p>Square Yards’ success rate with digital campaigns had helped us land an exclusive campaign with Godrej Properties – one of India’s most prestigious real estate developers- in the second quarter of year 2020. Run during the times when the entire country was under lockdown, the campaign ‘Hope has a Plan’ brought the idea of a safe and secure future to reality. This formed the fulcrum for the digital marketing efforts undertaken in ‘The Lockdown Phenomenon’ campaign. The highlight of this was the now-or-never 10:90 payment plan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a moment of pride and exhilaration, a spectacle that made our hearts swell with pride, when top developer <a href="https://www.squareyards.com/search?developerId=9083&amp;cityid=36">EMAAR</a> felicitated SQUARE YARDS with a grand illumination of its brand name atop the iconic Burj Khalifa, the world’s largest skyscraper.</p>
<p>EMAAR had a fruitful business relationship with <a href="https://www.squareyards.com/">Square Yards</a>, clocking an industry-leading revenue for the global real estate property developer.</p>
<p>Elated by this prestigious honour, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanuj-shori-420b402/">Tanuj Shori</a>, our Founder and CEO reiterated,” It is a memorable moment for us. Our little precious start-up, which now employs over 3,000 people has expanded its footprint to 9 countries in such a short span of time. Also noteworthy is that every new market we enter, we raise the entire home-buying-experience bar. EMAAR’s recognition of this fact with such an iconic message reiterates the fact that all stakeholders in the Real Estate value chain trust Square Yards’ business playbook. We are deeply grateful to EMAAR for this show of faith. Both EMAAR and <a href="https://www.squareyards.com/property-in-dubai">Dubai</a> have constantly been in our top 3 markets and developers list respectively and we feel that they will remain our top priorities for a long time.”</p>
<p>Beating real estate market hurdles year on year,<a href="https://www.squareyards.com/"> Square Yards</a> has posted industry leading growth figures so far in this fiscal as well. At current levels, the startup’s annual Gross Transactional Value (GTV) should exceed USD 1 bn while its annual revenue should be north of USD 45 mn.</p>
<p>The start-up has also turned profitable, a quality that has over time become increasingly dear to the investor fraternity worldwide. Square Yards looks at the gulf region seriously in an effort to increase its market share and has been investing heavily in people and technology to ramp up its operations in this geography.</p>
<p>During Q3 of FY20, Indian real estate operations contributed 65% to Square Yards’ overall revenue, 24% came from international business operations, while the remaining 11% was generated by its mortgage arm, Square Capital. With 75% growth, Square Yards’ international markets and mortgage teams have had their best revenue quarter till date. On the principal side, top rated developers like EMAAR, <a href="https://www.squareyards.com/search?developerId=2428&amp;cityid=0">WTC</a>, <a href="https://www.squareyards.com/search?developerId=49&amp;cityid=0">Godrej</a> and <a href="https://www.squareyards.com/search?developerId=181&amp;cityid=0">Gaur</a> continued to be major bestsellers at Square Yards.</p>
