These awards serve as a tribute to their outstanding performance across numerous real estate categories.\n\n\n\nThe campaign by Square Yards resulted in 3700+ transactions valued at Rs 2200 Crore and helped Square Yards gain almost 20% market share during the period for which the campaign was run. Timing of the innovative digital campaign made it an instant hit as people were looking for ways to overcome the unprecedented times. The major highlight of the campaign was the end-to-end online buying cycle facilitated by Square Yards.\n\n\n\nSquare Yards\u2019 success rate with digital campaigns had helped us land an exclusive campaign with Godrej Properties \u2013 one of India\u2019s most prestigious real estate developers- in the second quarter of year 2020. Run during the times when the entire country was under lockdown, the campaign \u2018Hope has a Plan\u2019 brought the idea of a safe and secure future to reality. This formed the fulcrum for the digital marketing efforts undertaken in \u2018The Lockdown Phenomenon\u2019 campaign. The highlight of this was the now-or-never 10:90 payment plan.\nThe post Square Yards Bags an Award for \u2018The Best Digital Campaign\u2019 appeared first on Real Estate News.",
