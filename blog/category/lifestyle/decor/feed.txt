<p class="has-text-align-justify">There is no secret that a homebuyer feels proud when the guest compliments the interiors of their abode. Well, gone are the days when ceilings were just considered as a part of the structure. Nevertheless, with the modern designing mindset, false ceilings have become an integral part of the home décor.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">With modular kitchens ruling the market, kitchen design has found a new dimension, and designers have their work cut out to create aesthetically alluring kitchen designs.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Creating a false ceiling design for the kitchen is tricky and needs careful analysis of both space and utility. Experienced designers working in this field have come up with beautiful kitchen designs for ceilings, which requires careful space management compared to designing false ceilings for other rooms of the home.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-a-false-ceiling">What is a false ceiling?</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">As the name suggests, a false ceiling is a ceiling placed under the original ceiling of a room, kitchen or an entire home to add an edge. It is normally suspended by wooden or metal frames either completely covering the original ceiling or is a part of the original ceiling based on the design and space availability. Usually, the mounting distance of the false ceiling from the original ceiling is around 8 inches. They are versatile and can fit into homes of any size and shape.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">False ceilings are used as a protective covering for original ceilings which helps in reducing wear and tear. False ceilings provide both aesthetic and functional benefits. They are extensively used in office buildings, IT firms, malls, and other commercial buildings, but with modern home designs, false ceilings in no time have become a mandatory interior design element in an Indian home. Among all the rooms, Kitchen is one place where the false ceiling is very effective.</p>



<h2 id="h-false-ceiling-designs-for-kitchen">False Ceiling Designs for Kitchen</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Selecting false ceiling designs for the kitchen can be a tad tricky and intimidating than choosing designs for other rooms. While the false ceiling designs for other rooms are mostly for aesthetics and wear and tear prevention. But in kitchen design, you have to pay heed to the cooking factor and less space availability. Hence the material and design should be carefully planned.</p>



<h2 id="h-some-basic-false-ceiling-designs-for-kitchen">Some basic false ceiling designs for kitchen</h2>



<h3 id="h-simple-false-ceiling-design-for-kitchen">Simple False Ceiling Design for Kitchen</h3>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">There is a notion that false ceilings have to be fancy and intricately designed with lots of hidden lighting to make them stand out. But, in reality, false ceilings are made to protect the original ceiling from wear and tear, moisture and enhance the beauty of the home. A simple false ceiling design for a kitchen using materials like wood or gypsum with LED backlighting can also do the trick for covering the original ceiling and also enhance the aesthetic appeal of the kitchen. Sometimes simple false ceiling designs for the kitchen are more effective and save space than complex designs made only for improving aesthetics. The false ceilings will also help in thermal insulation during cold conditions.</p>



<h3 id="h-false-ceiling-design-for-small-kitchen">False Ceiling Design for small kitchen</h3>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Small kitchens are very tricky for designing false ceilings as space is already compromised with the cooking area, water sink, grocery shelves, kitchen chimney, etc. Adding a false ceiling to an already tight space seems like a futile exercise. But with a false ceiling, we can eliminate the chimney as the air gap in these false ceilings can give a cooling effect, traps moisture, and displaces heat all over the kitchen. The material used for this type of kitchen design should be light, and hence wood or fiber can be a great choice. We have to ensure the materials used are water-resistant as the kitchen is second to the bathroom when it comes to dampness.</p>



<h3 id="h-pop-plaster-of-paris-false-ceiling-design-for-kitchen">POP (Plaster of Paris) False Ceiling Design for Kitchen</h3>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Plaster of Paris is one of the most commonly used materials for a false ceiling for many decades. It is economical and can be easily shaped. It is mixed with water and applied on a wooden base or a fiberboard of a required shape and then suspended from the original ceiling. As this is not a pre-fabricated process, a lot of skill and workmanship are needed to get the job done. POP false ceilings possess unique features and are apt for use in kitchen designs. They can be painted with various colors and also are light in weight. They are also easily customized. They are suitable for large spaces. The thickness of these ceilings ranges from 12-15mm.</p>



<h3 id="h-modern-kitchen-false-ceiling-design">Modern kitchen false ceiling design</h3>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Modern homes are designed in various themes in terms of technical, functional, and aesthetic requirements. Beautiful kitchen design for the ceiling is also one of the key components in modern kitchens. There is a lot of scope in terms of design experimentation when it comes to modern kitchens. Modern kitchen’s false ceiling comes with beams, slats, insulation, and built-in lighting. Metal panels are used but designed in such a way that the number of frames is minimized, and the overall weight is significantly reduced. It is very easy to install, and a consistent design will give it a beautiful look. It is also very easy to clean. But the only drawback is overheating, and designers are thinking of using better and new innovative heat resistant materials for this.</p>



<h2 id="h-some-questions-regarding-the-false-ceiling-design-of-the-kitchen">Some questions regarding the false ceiling design of the kitchen</h2>



<h3 id="h-what-are-the-different-materials-used-in-false-ceiling-design-for-kitchen">What are the different materials used in False Ceiling Design for Kitchen?</h3>

The different materials used for False Ceiling Design for Kitchen are Wood, Plaster of Paris, Gypsum, PVC, metal, glass, fiber, fabric.</p>

<h3 id="h-can-a-false-ceiling-make-the-kitchen-more-spacious">Can a false ceiling make the kitchen more spacious?</h3>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">If properly designed and good heat-dissipating materials are used, the false ceiling can replace a chimney using the air gap between the false ceiling and the original ceiling. This will save more space, and also, with prefix lighting in the false ceiling, further space will be optimized and can be used to add additional racks or shelves.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">It makes sure that the fixtures are not visible from the outside. When you look up at such a design, you can only see the beautiful light giving the room a character of its own. These lights also provide an outdoorsy kind of vibe to the whole room.</p>



<h3 id="h-skies-and-clouds-with-pop-designs">Skies and clouds with POP designs</h3>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">POP is an excellent material to use while designing your false ceiling. It can be easily molded and sourced. A sky-themed roof can be created with POP. Bedrooms with sky and clouds on the ceiling have long been a favorite of both children and parents, and they continue to be at the top of the list of children&#8217;s room interior designs. The best part is that these ceiling designs are appropriate for children of all ages, from toddlers to preschoolers to tweens.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">You can incorporate this design by painting the light ceiling blue with white POP clouds or cloud stickers scattered around the room.</p>



<h2 id="h-play-with-colors-kids-room-wall-colour-ideas">Play with colors | Kids Room Wall Colour Ideas</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Even if your entire house is painted a little sober, you can go all out with the colors in the kids&#8217; room. Children have very active and bubbly personalities, so they like bright and bold colors. Play and experiment with different colors on the ceiling. This would help give the room a playful Aura while also making it engaging for the child.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Ask your kid if he/she has a particular color in mind. Giving preference to their likes and dislikes is very important as they would be the ones living in that room. The false ceilings of this kind can be easily built with gypsum boards or plaster.</p>



<h2 id="h-treat-it-as-your-canvas">Treat it as your canvas</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Treating the fifth wall as a canvas encourages and motivates your child&#8217;s artistic talents. Hand-painted false ceilings are always a sight to look at. The use of paints and colors in false ceiling designs for children&#8217;s rooms is a creative way of styling them. Murals and watercolors tell a story while bringing a light, airy feel to the false ceiling. Bright colors are mood lifters and give out positive energies.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">If you try a whimsical theme, it could have a dreamy appearance with dimmable lights and floating ceilings. Even if your child is young, an aesthetic, eye-catching bedroom ceiling can make a powerful visual statement on the child&#8217;s mind.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-a-single-tier-false-ceiling">What is a Single tier false ceiling?</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">This kind of ceiling has a single layer to it. Something like this could do the trick for you if you want to draw attention away from small spaces in the room or those lacking in décor. When you add bright, vibrant colors, beautifully created shapes, and lighting options, it instantly makes the room more alive.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">You can bring it up by incorporating interesting &#8216;Glow-in-the-dark&#8217; patterns, images, or stickers, etc. This adds an interesting edge to the room, which is sure to engage your kid&#8217;s interest and make him more imaginative.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Starry-night-with-layers-for-your-little-stargazer-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-31039" srcset="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Starry-night-with-layers-for-your-little-stargazer-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Starry-night-with-layers-for-your-little-stargazer-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Starry-night-with-layers-for-your-little-stargazer-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Starry-night-with-layers-for-your-little-stargazer-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Starry-night-with-layers-for-your-little-stargazer-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Layers are great to experiment with if lights are a star of your ceiling concept. For example, if you are going for an enchanting night sky theme for your kid&#8217;s ceiling, a multi-layered ceiling carved out in the edges and center of the ceiling makes the room look more spacious while creating drama and adding splendor to the interior.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">These ceilings go perfectly with rope lights. They are also comparatively safer than all the other ceilings as they provide housing to electrical wires hence insulating the room.</p>



<h2 id="h-suspended-hangings-with-coffered-panel-designs">Suspended hangings with coffered panel designs</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In this type of design, coffered panels are attached to the ceiling. In a single room, you can create designs of various sizes. If your little one is into art and craft like origami or paper Mache, then you can stick his masterpieces to the ceiling too.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">This not only elevates the aesthetics of the room but also adds detail and drama to it. Kids love their art being appreciated and displayed like that. This type of ceiling itself creates the illusion of light. However, you can add other kinds of lights to it too.</p>



<h2 id="h-favorite-characters">Favorite characters</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">We all know how much kids love their cartoon characters. When they like a cartoon, they need it everywhere on their bags, lunch boxes, clothes, etc., so why not use your kids&#8217; favorite characters or movies as an inspiration for a false ceiling. There&#8217;s no limit to being imaginative with these designs. You can even personalize them as you want. Don&#8217;t forget to ask your child for suggestions.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-solar-system-with-hanging-planets">A solar system with hanging planets</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Parents always love it when learning is added to a kid&#8217;s room décor. The plus-minus ceiling refers to elements of a design that protrude from a regular ceiling. The use of POP in the design can contrast and highlight a design while also adding style and class to the ceiling space. If you are thinking of something extravagant like a realistic solar system on the ceiling, the plus-minus false ceilings with POP will make the planets and stars bulge out from the regular ceilings while also enhancing the design and highlighting it. Themes like the galaxy and solar system look nice on kids&#8217; ceilings.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">They help in generating your kids&#8217; interest in physics and outer space from a very young age. These types of ceilings are ideal for dreamy ceiling themes.</p>



<h2 id="h-using-gypsum-to-create-a-simple-look">Using gypsum to create a simple look</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Sometimes less is more, and going simple is better. If your kid is between the age of 10 to 15, then too dramatic or too childlike themes could upset them unless they demanded it. False ceilings created by installing Gypsum panels can be a solution that provides a seamless and smooth finish. Moreover, Gypsum panels are not that expensive either. They are simple to install, maintain, and they last longer. If this doesn&#8217;t seem good enough, you can pair gypsum with neon lights, creating a theatrical aura.</p>



<h2 id="h-let-the-woodwork-do-the-magic">Let the Woodwork do the magic</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">For babies, a room that can soothe and comfort them is essential. Wood is known to give warm and calming energy, so if money isn&#8217;t an issue designing the ceiling with wood is a great pick. It also significantly improves the room&#8217;s acoustics. Wood designs are classic and timeless. The beauty they emit is on another level. Moreover, their insulation properties are like a cherry on top.</p>



<h2 id="h-princesses-theme-ceiling">Princesses Theme Ceiling</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Having a girl is a blessing, and lucky are those who have little princesses in their houses, make sure your Princess lives in a castle.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The bohemian-themed ceiling is a perfect choice for your girl. Add a dreamy feel to the room with a touch of fabric. A multi-colored fabric-draped false ceiling combined with a lighting fixture can create an enticing and thrilling atmosphere. Girls always prefer a room that has a cozy feel to it. Living in a space like this is almost every girl&#8217;s dream.</p>



<h2 id="h-wallpaper-ceiling">Wallpaper ceiling</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Another cost-effective way of elevating your child&#8217;s room is using wallpapers. They can be changed often so your child won&#8217;t get bored of them. These days options like 3D prints and the ones that glow at night are also available. They decorate the ceiling with creativity and add style.</p>



<h2 id="h-sports-inspired-ceiling">Sports inspired ceiling</h2>



<p>If your child is into sports, you can prepare a sports-inspired false ceiling. Ask your kid what sports he likes specifically; you can create a ceiling with a personalized touch.</p>



<p>For instance, if he likes football, you can go for a make-believe football field teamed ceiling.</p>



<p>What you should know before selecting a false ceiling for your kid.</p>

It is kind of like a fantasy to them.</li><li>Coming up with something unusual, unique and funny is fine but make sure your child understands it.</li><li>Themes like heaven, flowers, forests, etc., are very common.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Many people opt for varying <strong>wall color combinations</strong> in their homes.

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is no secret that pink is a preferred choice for those seeking attractive <strong>house painting colour combinations</strong>. Pink was first used to name a colour back in the 17<sup>th</sup> century and was named after a flower as per reports. Pink is a part of the family of red colors but in comparison to red, it is more soothing or calming if you may use the term. Pink is a color that is more associated with sweetness, femininity, joy and compassion along with overall harmony. You must know that colors do impact our mood greatly. You will of course have to love the color that you are choosing for your home including the living room and <strong>bedroom wall color combination</strong> since these are the zones where you will be spending most of your time.

A pale pink hue offers more positivity and relaxation alike while also indicating kindness and tenderness. These are aspects that people should keep in mind while planning for integrating <strong>bedroom paint two colors </strong>or other suitable themes.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What designers feel about pink</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Studies confirm why people choose <strong>pink two color combination for bedroom walls</strong> and other <strong>shades of pink</strong> in their homes. It is because higher amounts of pink may help in calming the nerves while also creating an ambiance where there is lesser physical volatility and aggression. However, you should be careful about not overdoing things. It is good to opt for <strong>pink color shades </strong>but there should be a mix of other hues as well. For example, you may choose a <strong>blue two color combination for bedroom walls </strong>in tandem with pink being used as a contrast. This will break the monotony and prevent overexposure to this shade.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can also find varied pink tones for <strong>hall wall color</strong>s and even the kitchen. Pink is not always akin to fluffiness, cuteness, a bubblegum effect or that Barbie-girl effect. Brighter hues such as fuchsia may indicate glamour and higher energy while softer pink hues like blush or even beige with pink undertones may lead to that feeling of calm and tranquility. Some interior designers just love the <em>fresh</em> vibe that pink hues bring to any home. Many feel that those who prefer using white for a <strong>wall paint color combination </strong>or even a <strong>simple two color combination for bedroom walls</strong>, should try the pink shade. It can be something with a little grey fused into it and not necessarily the bubblegum variety. You may use a more intense hue of pink for an area where you spend less time like the entry passage or deep pink for a dining room with raspberry undertones for more warmth and reflected light alike.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are seeking a more handy <strong>pink color combination </strong>for home, you can pair this shade with several other types of colors such as black, chocolate brown, metallic gold, mint green, silver, white and even gold for building moods of a diverse nature. You may even pair with navy blue or other masculine hues for creating a more balanced effect overall. Dusty pinks can be integrated with neutral hues for scaling up the glamour quotient in your bedroom. Pink may feel more plush when it is paired with beige or brown. This is a good idea for your dining room. Make sure that you know where to use the <strong>light pink color </strong>and also <strong>how to make pink color</strong>s of a darker hue contrast neatly against lighter shades.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <em>God of Cricket</em>, Sachin Tendulkar, needs no introduction. There has been immense interest in knowing about <strong>Sachin Tendulkar house</strong>s in Mumbai and overall <strong>Sachin Tendulkar property</strong> in India. <strong>Sachin’s house </strong>was earlier in a plush apartment complex. However, the new <strong>Sachin Tendulkar home</strong>s in Mumbai are a bungalow and luxurious apartment respectively. One <strong>Sachin house </strong>is at Perry Cross Road at Bandra West. This <strong>Sachin Tendulkar house in Mumbai </strong>and the family’s primary residence, covers a massive 6,000 square feet. The <strong>Sachin Tendulkar house price </strong>was reportedly around Rs. 39 crore which the superstar paid for buying the plot in the year 2007. He has spent another 40-45 crores on renovations and transforming the dilapidated villa that once sat on this plot, into the imposing 5-storied villa that we see today.</p>
<p>Another <strong>Sachin house in Mumbai </strong>is the lavish property that he purchased for Anjali Tendulkar, his wife, in Mumbai. This <strong>Sachin Tendulkar house address</strong> is at Rustomjee Seasons in the BKC (Bandra-Kurla Complex) and the <strong>Tendulkar house</strong> reportedly cost around Rs. 7.5 crore. This is a spacious 1600 square feet apartment with luxurious amenities and facilities. Interestingly, sometime earlier, an Anjali <strong>Tendulkar house</strong> in the ultra-prime Malabar Hill, Mumbai, was sold to a businessman for a whopping sum of Rs. 145 crore. <em>Mehta House</em>, this property, belonged to her parents.</p>
<h3><strong>Sachin Tendulkar house facts </strong></h3>
<p>The current <strong>Sachin Tendulkar home in Mumbai </strong>was reconstructed after he purchased the plot in the year 2007 at Perry Cross Road. He shifted into this property with his family in the year 2011. The overall <strong>Sachin home </strong>cost thus stands at upwards of Rs. 80 crore. The pre-independence property housed a classic Paris villa and it is now a sprawling villa with five floors and 1 ½ floors remain underground as per BMC guidelines pertaining to the heights of buildings. The bungalow lies along one of Mumbai’s most prime locations with a view of the Arabian Sea as well.</p>
<p>The area is home to numerous celebrities and movie stars alike. Sachin Tendulkar has reportedly taken out an insurance policy of Rs. 100 crore for this property, inclusive of Rs. 75 crore in fire insurance and added coverage of Rs. 25 crore for its interiors. This policy also offers coverage for damages owing to acts of God like earthquakes, terrorism and other activities like bomb blasts, burglaries and so on. Items like the compound walls, cost of the land of the bungalow, security installations, water reservoir and electrical equipment are also covered under this insurance plan. The 3-storied mansion comes with two basements and they can readily house 40-50 cars together. There is a secondary kitchen on the upper basement along with the servant quarters and a master surveillance zone for security requirements.</p>
<p>There is a high-walled fence for this property which restricts outside views and the ground floor has a temple where the star cricketer’s mother spends a lot of her time. The kitchen is sleek with a contemporary cook-top and granite countertop while the cricketer has his favorite corner in the bungalow where he records a majority of his videos on Instagram. He relaxes in the garden area as well which has a small sitting area or cabana where he records messages. Numerous lovely paintings adorn the home and the huge living room comes with brown and white hues. The living room has premium couches with vibrant cushions and the ceiling is close to 20 feet! The bungalow also comes with a glass bridge linking the lobby of two separate structures in reality. One side has the master bedroom and the other side has the rooms of the children. The bungalow has a big garden with rows and rows of shrubs, palm trees, tropical plants, a small pond and succulents.</p>
<h3><strong>Sachin Tendulkar’s Mumbai apartment- Key Facts</strong></h3>
<p>Sachin Tendulkar purchased a lavish apartment in Rustomjee Seasons, BKC, for his wife Anjali Tendulkar sometime earlier. This home has been designed by the Singapore-based interior design firm, Etho Space.

This backdrop created an opportunity for interior designers and gifting companies like Bloom &#8217;89, who hit upon innovative ideas to spruce up the festive spirit at home by advocating the use of common household items such as clothes, towels, bottles, discarded glass, and house plants to create an elegant home décor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ganesh Chaturthi is the time for renovation and new projects. Once this idea of eco-friendly Puja celebrations began gaining popularity, devotees realized they could spruce up their homes creatively with old and often discarded items, and turn them into a small temple without going out of the house and without spending on expensive trappings. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The emphasis is on using eco-friendly materials for all activities in the Ganesh Puja, including the idol itself. Brightly coloured Idols available in the market are mostly made with Plaster of Paris and coloured with chemicals that are injurious to health. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The trend is to innovate, keeping Covid-19 restrictions in mind by avoiding crowded marketplaces and using material available at home to add vibrancy to the festival. This boosts the creative streak within family members and encourages the spirit to conserve, preserve and recycle. As a result, almost nothing is discarded and new uses are found for materials that would have normally been neglected.           </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A God is born</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lord Ganesh is the God of Wisdom and prosperity. Lord Ganesh is the Hindu God who symbolizes new beginnings, and this is the reason Lord Ganesh is worshipped at the beginning of all puja rituals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lord Ganesh is the child of Lord Shiva and Goddess Gauri. His brother is Lord Kartikeya, the God of War, and his sister Ashokasundari. Lord Ganesh was married to Riddhi (Prosperity) and Siddhi (Spirituality). The children of Lord Ganesh are Shubh (auspicious) and Laabh (Profit). That is the reason why the terms Riddhi, Siddhi, Shubh, and Laabh are associated with this God. 108 names know Lord Ganesh, but the most significant are Vighnaharta (Remover of Obstacles), Lambodara (for His pot Belly), and Ekadanta (One tusk as the other is broken). These names can be heard in the chants of the Ganesh Stuti and Ganesh Aarti.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lord Ganesh was a divine creation by his mother, Parvati, who created an idol from the rouge applied to her body during her bath and breathed life into the idol. Ganesh Puja is performed on the fourth day of the waxing moon during the Hindu month of Magh, hence Ganesh Chaturthi&#8217;s name.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How Ganesh Chaturthi c</strong><strong>elebrations began?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The origins of the Ganesh Chaturthi are lost in history. The earliest known celebrations of Ganesh Chaturthi are traceable to the dynasties of Satavahanas, the Rashtrakutas, and the Chalukyas. It is widely known and recorded that Chhatrapati Shivaji initiated Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations in Maharashtra in the seventeenth century. This grand tradition continued after this and received wide patronage during the nineteenth century during the time of the Peshwas. Lord Ganesh was the family deity of the Peshwa, and Ganesh Chaturthi came to be celebrated all over Maharashtra and wherever there were Maharashtrians. However, Ganesh Puja suffered a setback during British rule when people had to perform the Puja in their homes until Bal Gangadhar Tilak revived the pomp and gaiety of this ritual.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations have continued thereafter, and even today, this is the biggest festival in Maharastra. In addition, Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated by Hindus worldwide, and every Hindu ritual begins with the Ganesh Puja.  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are certain interesting anecdotes associated with the Ganesh Chaturthi. The chant of “Ganapati Bappa Morya” was never in the scriptures. Morya is said to be the name of a pious Ganesh devotee lost in the pages of history. Somehow his name got attached to Ganesh and hence the chant. Lord Ganesh is said to have been a Naga, and this is mentioned in the Ganesh Stuti.   </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How can you add festive spirit to Ganpati Decoration</strong><strong>?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the ways to add a festive spirit to Ganpati decoration with eco-friendly material available at home is to use a theme for decoration. For example, for homes with a garden, a theme can be made by using flowers of a similar colour and using the same colour on earth soil, paper, and other materials. The theme used will showcase a festive atmosphere inside the home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another way is to make an improvised rangoli with material available at home. For example, turmeric, henna, rice powder, and old Holi colours can be useful in making an attractive rangoli without going out of the house to buy rangoli colours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are several tips to make the Ganpati Puja enjoyable. First, involve the whole family in making innovative and creative seating arrangements for family members. One way is to use old mattresses and cover them with bedcovers and use cushions for the backrest. Another way is to paint an old trunk and cover it with bedclothes and soft cushions for sitting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Vegetables, fruits, and home-cooked desserts can be used for the prasad. A family member can do the Ganesh Puja. Several websites give clear stepwise instructions on how to perform puja with all rituals and the correct mantras. Many families use cleaned stainless steel plates and mirror finish plates as Puja Thalis.  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The whole ceremony becomes an enjoyable &#8220;Do it yourself&#8221; experience that is both satisfying, inexpensive, and spiritually exhilarating experience with a personal touch.                           </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Do’s and don&#8217;ts for Eco-Friendly Ganpati Decoration at home </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Do’s</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Use pebbles, beads, old dupattas, and torn saris for decoration. The pebbles can be painted with water or oil colours, depending on what’s available at home </li>
<li>Make decorative rangolis out of cloth cut out flowers, old imitation jewelry, glass beads</li>
<li>Decorate the area around the mandap with banana and bamboo steams and banana leaves</li>
<li>Utilise common home items like coloured string, cork, bamboo shoots, coir ropes.</li>
<li>Make bowls from old discarded cloth and old newspapers. Use double layers to make them stronger. Decorate them with leaves, and they can be used for serving prasad </li>
<li>Break coconut shells into decorative pieces, use wheat dough with turmeric to turn them into innovative diyas.</li>
<li>Use wooden pedestals or low stools covered with decorative cloth for the throne of Lord Ganesh. </li>
<li>Use old glass bottles as lampshades. Insert a bulb and a holder and get the improvised lamps working. The glass on the bottles can be painted with light watercolors available at home to get the effect of coloured lights. </li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Don&#8217;ts</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Don’t use plastics. They are not biodegradable and certainly not eco-friendly.</li>
<li>Don’t use thermacol plates and bowls. There are biodegradable alternatives such as leaves of bananas and other plants.            </li>
<li>Don’t throw away the decorations. Store them safely. Most of them can be used the following year again.</li>
<li>Don’t keep the idol inside the temple after the Puja. The idol can be kept separately in the puja room and can be used the following year again.</li>
<li>Don’t use the same idol if it has got chipped or damaged in any way. Then, using such an idol is considered inauspicious. </li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Word of caution</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rules regarding community worship and elaborate immersion ceremonies have become very strict in the last 2 years since the outbreak of Covid-19 and the successive lockdowns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mostly, the town and city administrative bodies have strict rules forbidding community pujas and going in groups to a river or sea for immersion. Using eco-friendly material with things at home, creatively, is the best way to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is better to make the idol at home by immersing clay in water to make it a pliable dough that can be made into diverse shapes. The idol can be used the following year by sprinkling some water as a symbolic immersion after completing this year’s puja.           </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the flip side, there is a good outcome from the covid-19 situation. Family members are spending more time at home, getting a do-it-yourself experience, saving money, and indulging in such community activities at home. There is no need to hire a priest, buy expensive decorative puja material that cannot be recycled. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The word of caution is a blessing in disguise, for it has spurred a revolutionary innovation of its own.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">False ceilings are subsidiary ceilings that are swung from the primary roof. False ceilings are utilized to conceal extreme wiring and are efficient for making your residence slightly more charming and chaotic-free. These secondary ceilings are either constructed of Gypsum plasterboard or Plaster of Paris (POP). But nowadays Gypsum false ceilings are being applied mainly and particularly in urban cities. Plaster of Paris (POP) false ceiling is used quite seldom now but only in rural areas and small villages.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What is a gypsum false ceiling?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gypsum ceilings boards are built using gypsum plasterboards, secured with a screw/bolt to a frame (made of metal) attached and secured to the undersurfaces. Gypsum plasterboard is developed in bigger sheets and hence there are lesser joints than the POP plasterboards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gypsum is hydrated calcium sulfate and its efficiency is ideal for long-term usage. They are prepared in a prefabricated form, which is produced in a factory and glued together or joined on-site. Gypsum is widely utilized in places that have open area space and need central air ventilation units.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The installation process of gypsum plasterboard is speedier and is neat, much more practical, and more robust due to less sediment and residue. When Gypsum plasterboard is installed, it is almost dust-free work. Gypsum plasterboard is stronger than POP plasterboards. The main reason for the Gypsum plasterboard&#8217;s use nowadays is due to hydrophobic properties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gypsum false ceiling allows elevated versatility in configuration. Gypsum plasterboard’s flexibility makes it the most favored plasterboard for false ceilings. Price-wise there is not much variation between the Gypsum and POP plasterboard. There are two types of Gypsum False Ceiling- Plain Gypsum Ceiling and Perforated Gypsum Ceiling.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Plain Gypsum Ceiling</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The plain plasterboard ceiling is a unified dangled system that permits you to accomplish an elegant, uniform, consistent appearance and a smooth level surface without any noticeable joints. Curved shapes, tracks, and other design alternatives can also be delivered with plasterboards.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><strong>Perforated Gypsum Ceiling</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The perforated ceilings provide higher acoustics blended with unique aesthetics and great indoor climate execution. These ceilings are formed out of natural elements and do not hold any environmentally hazardous materials.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are different types of materials that are used for manufacturing Gypsum Ceilings. Following are some of the False Ceiling Gypsum Boards differentiated according to their materials:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Regular/Standard Gypsum Board</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This type of gypsum board is ideal for creating false ceilings. The front surface is wrapped with ivory cardboard, the back surface with gray cardboard, and the edges are surrounded with blue tape.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><strong>Fire Resistance Gypsum Board</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fire resistance is an essential characteristic people look for in building materials. The fire protection gypsum board has a pink cardboard face front, pink or grey bottom, and red tape-enveloped edges. This gypsum board is idyllic for both household and business buildings.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><strong>Moisture-resistant gypsum board</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moisture-resistant gypsum board is most suitable for regions that endure dense moisture. Moisture can make gypsum board ceilings musty. To sojourn that, use the moisture-resistant gypsum board.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><strong>Fire and Moisture-Resistant Gypsum Board</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As it is obvious from the title, fire and moisture-resistant gypsum boards amalgamate the strength of the fire-resistant and moisture-resistant properties. It is adequately immune to both fire and as well as moisture.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="5">
<li><strong>Abuse-Resistant Gypsum Panels</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These gypsum panels are extremely better than the regular ones. They give the below benefits:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Immune to surface dent</li>
<li>Abrasion-proof</li>
<li>Free of damage after penetration</li>
</ul>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="6">
<li><strong>Exterior Gypsum Soffit Board</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This false ceiling is impeccable for outside spaces like canopies and verandas. It is immune to climate exposure.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="7">
<li><strong>Foil-Backed Gypsum Board</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To prepare this board, laminated aluminium foil is utilized to incorporate the backside of the regular gypsum board. The foil serves as a wall to vapour.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="8">
<li><strong>Impact-Resistant Gypsum Panel</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The impact resistance property provided by these Gypsum panels is needed for installing false ceilings in residential flats.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="9">
<li><strong>Water-Resistant Gypsum Board</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This gypsum board is water-resistant. The paper covering is also waterproof.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Advantages and Disadvantages of gypsum false ceilings</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is very important to understand the working, materials, and quality of products before installing. Below are the pros and cons of using gypsum false ceilings:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Gypsum board false ceilings are available in a ready-to-install structure. They are attached with screws to a metal frame that is fixed to the roof plate. Screws can help to attach the gypsum board to the roof/ceiling.</li>
<li>A gypsum ceiling has a quick and dust-free system of installation that reduces dirt throughout the process of fitting.</li>
<li>A gypsum board false ceiling has an endless, even exterior. As these boards are huge, the quantity of joints is less. These joints are with a substance that dries speedily.</li>
<li>Gypsum boards are straightforward and simple to design, shape, and paint because of their flat, polished surface.</li>
<li>They are built in a factory. As a result, the characteristics of the gypsum board are consistently excellent.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Though gypsum false ceilings are simple to install, the entire uninstallation method can be pretty tiresome. If you have to fix the ceiling, it would mean tearing the entire thing down.</li>
<li>It’s simply a matter of time before precipitation leaks into the false ceiling, it can be within cracked roofs or air conditioning ducts. This can commence with fungal germination or prompt the ceilings to drop their shape. To circumvent this nuisance, it’s best if you choose moisture-resistant boards.</li>
<li>Gypsum boards are costlier than Plaster of Paris (POP)</li>
<li>As time passes by, a gypsum false ceiling may expose indications of cuts near the joints. These fractures may arise due to sparse movements in the false ceilings that originated due to ceiling renovation, making holes for tube lights and fan accessories, or in areas where the ceiling joins the connected walls.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Gypsum Board Installation steps</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Step 1: Wall Control</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The condition and security of the main wall are measured. The line on which the curved silhouettes have to be set is marked with a pen. The impression on the ground is taken to the ceiling with the guidance of plumb and sketched to the ceiling with the guidance of the painted string rope.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Step 2: Preparation of Metal Profiles</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The size of the appareling wall is measured with a measuring tape and the U profiles are shaped according to this size. C profiles are sliced 1 cm at ceiling height for ease of installation. When the C profiles are cast to their complete length, even the tiniest likely errors throughout assembly can end in very high results while installation. Sound protector tapes are located below the profiles before they are joined. The quantity of C profiles is determined by taking the axle spacing of the outlines to 60 cm. For wet volume wall treatments, axle spacing should be 40 cm.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Step 3: Fixing U-Profiles</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">U-profiles are scaled to the floor and ceiling with the guidance of dowels + screws + washers utilizing a drill.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Step 4: Fixing The Staples</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The relevant staples accordingly span between the cladding wall and the house wall and are attached to the wall utilizing dowels and screws.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Step 5: Installation Works And Insulation</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Electrical cables and pipe installments should be completed before putting the panels. For example, to cover the resources of your plumbing or electrical system, you can utilize an access panel system.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Step 6: Plasterboard Screwing</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fixing the gypsum boards to the U and C profiles simultaneously on the sides with the bolts/screws using a tool or hammer. When screwing, take care that the screw gaps are not higher than 30 cm and that the screws are taken off adequately. When screwing, the screws should not be tighter than 1 cm to the sides of the gypsum board.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Step 7: Coating and Finishing Surface</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You have to repair holes or cover breaks and cuts in the corner. For a cleaner and more meticulous finishing surface, you can use the all-purpose ready-mix collective mixture for instance. After the primary drying, the second layer of a joint compound is imperative. Also, remember that, depending on climate and moisture, the drying time can range between 12 and 24 hours. Once dried and everything finished, you can start painting your gypsum boards.</p>

<h2><strong>What are wall stickers, wall decals, and wall murals?</strong></h2>
<p>Before giving out details, it is better to start with the basics. So for someone new to the field, <strong>wall stickers</strong> or <strong>wall decals </strong>are stickers that can be applied on a wall. They are mainly used for designing and informational purposes depending on one&#8217;s motif. One can get them in various shapes, designs, colours and customized with pictures or quotes printed on them.  </p>

<p>They are cost-effective and can be easily applied and removed without any professional aid. The ideal <strong>benefit of wall stickers, wall decals, and murals</strong> is that they can be replaced without any hassle, with the new ones as per the latest trends. These are décor ideas that have gained mass fame among millennials and thrifty avant-garde.</p>
<h2><strong>Why use Wall Stickers, Wall Decals, and Wall Murals?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Wall stickers and Murals </strong>can be the best option if you are looking for a temporary change in your room. This is because it enhances the vibrancy and space of the room. Moreover, it is a feasible option for people living in rented houses who cannot make permanent changes in their apartments according to their choice.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to make nail holes or drill marks on your beautiful wall, these are the perfect go-to possibilities to achieve your dream décor. And, most importantly who will not want to decorate their homes all by themselves and enjoy the appreciation which comes their way.</p>
<h2><strong>Right choices for your Home</strong></h2>
<p>A classic look can be achieved by using your designing inclination judiciously while purchasing <strong>wall stickers</strong>, <strong>wall decals</strong>, and<strong> wall murals</strong> for their home. </p>
<p>First, of course, one needs to consider the type of space being decorated.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em><u>Living Room</u></em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The center of attraction for guests in the living room as it is the first room in which they enter. And the old saying, &#8220;the first impression is the last impression,” has its value here.</p>
<p>Expensive-looking accessories add to the sophistication of your living room. For example, a large pink chrysanthemum flower wall design to compliment your white sofa set will be the perfect décor. It will also give a unique look, unlike the common photo frames.</p>
<p>A large <strong>wall mural</strong> will help in filling the extra space and give an illusion of a larger area. Ocean views, forest scenes, and even architectural pieces can fit in and make the area stand out. The right choice of wall mural or wall decal is important as it will become the statement piece of your house.</p>
<p>A <strong>wall sticker</strong> <strong>for living room</strong> with wooden prints will add to the look and is an inexpensive alternative to your existing wall decor. At first, these stickers are hard to distinguish for not being the real solid. And, these wall decals are not meant only for walls but can also be used to redecorate your windows, doors, and even ceilings.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h5><strong><em><u>Bedroom</u></em></strong></h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Not only the living room but also your bedroom can be adorned sophisticatedly as per your choice, at minimum expense.</p>
<p>How about a serene Buddha <strong>wall mural, </strong>or one depicting beautiful scenery.</p>
<p>It not only lets you enjoy a view that you desire but also an urbane scintilla at such a pocket-friendly price.</p>
<p>Also, a hanging <strong>wall sticker </strong>will be fit to fill up the wall space behind your bed and will surely give the room a new look altogether. </p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong><em><u>Corners</u></em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>What about your staircase ends and the small wall at its side. These are the corners where no matter how hard one tries, any accessories cannot be added. But, that does not mean that these areas cannot have beautiful décor?</p>
<p><strong>Wall Decals</strong><strong> for corners </strong>allow you to give the neglected areas a fascinating look without any hindrance in their functionality. A lamp post decal or a butterfly trail will be apt for an artistic spot.</p>
<p>A wall frame will be the eye candy and help in covering the space around your wall photo or television. Hence, wall stickers, wall murals, and wall decals are the best choice for thrifty decoration around the corner.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h5><strong><em><u>Kitchen space</u></em></strong></h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The kitchen wall between the chimney and the counter is often left blank. <strong>Wall stickers,</strong> will not only help hide those spaces but will also keep the cooking space clean. Dark or multi-colored stickers will be the right option for such spaces because the dirt and dust are not clearly visible on darker hues.</p>
<p>A <strong>wall decal</strong> with a chef printed on it or some cooking equipment on a bland-colored background will not suit the kitchen but will also make you want to cook more often. Thus, kitchen décor can be as simple as baking a cake and as beautiful as the icing. </p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong><em><u>Children’s room</u></em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When you have children in your home, a room has to be customized specially for them. A playroom or bedroom to start with. Now, you cannot add chandeliers or lamps to your children’s room because they can turn out to be harmful for a toddler. Moreover, it&#8217;s a not-so-good investment piece for a child’s room.</p>
<p>Instead, a <strong>wall sticker</strong> with animal or cartoon prints will do the job better. And, wall murals of cars, toys, butterflies, or dolls can also be considered as an option. And, these props can be a catalyst to promote a child&#8217;s motor development and keep their surroundings cheerful.</p>
<p>You can always remove these decorations as your child grows up and re-furnish them accordingly. The best, inexpensive, multi-purpose, and up-to-the-minute solution for decorating the room is <strong>wall sticker</strong><strong>s for kids’ room.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Other Important Factors</strong></h2>
<p>With the above-mentioned solutions, you can enhance your home with the best and affordable options according to the space available. However, there are multiple points that you need to keep in mind before choosing the correct <strong>wall sticker</strong> for your happy place.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em><u>Color Combination</u></em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>One of the many <strong>benefits of wall stickers </strong>is that it is available in numerous colours and patterns to suit the customer&#8217;s needs. To get an amazing look for your home, you need to make sure that the<strong> wall stickers</strong> that you choose compliment your furniture and walls rather than being in contrast until it&#8217;s necessary.</p>
<p>Choosing light-colored <strong>wall murals</strong> for dark background will be perfect only if your furniture is light in colour.</p>
<p>A large multi-colored <strong>wall decal</strong> will give a hotchpotch for a monochromatic white room.  </p>
<p>If positive suggestions are to be put in, a combination of yellow and purple looks great. A design with an off-white background will complement a royal blue-colored wall in a room with white furniture. You can browse through various apps as they can help you decide the best-suited wall sticker for your room according to your home’s existing colour palette. </p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h5><strong><em><u>Signature piece </u></em></strong></h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Wall murals</strong> often become the centre of attraction in a room. They highlight a specific area or corner and are considered to be a showpiece. They add vibrancy to a plain wall, colours to a bland room, and an exciting interior to a monotonous one. In simple terms, they add a charm to the area being decorated.</p>
<p>Not only they are a cost-friendly way to maintain the house, but also a solution for people who apply these only for a temporary period and like to renovate their homes, frequently. They complement the space; make it look bigger and more illustrious. Horizontal stripes can help in giving a messy and cluttered room, a perfect voluminous look. They are an exemplary alternative of decor for renters.</p>
<p>Large <strong>wall murals</strong> also can give a refined guise to an apartment. One can also get rid of various little pieces that may or may not fit in the space when replaced with a single sticker. </p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong><em><u>To complete the missing element. </u></em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Wall decals</strong> are mainly used to fill the empty spaces. But these are supposed to complement the space as well as the budget. So, for example, a plain wall in the dining area can be adorned with multi-colored Madhubani designs, which are easily available online at affordable prices.</p>
<p>They can as well create a distraction from minor flaws in the room if placed accordingly. There are numerous <strong>benefits of wall stickers</strong> that can be used to fill the &#8216;something is missing&#8217; component of your home. </p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong><em><u>Do it yourself (DIY)</u></em></strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Customized <strong>wall stickers, wall decals, and wall murals</strong> help in getting the desired look for the house according to the owner’s whim. Though these might cost a few extra pennies, depending upon the designing cost and printing size but they are worth it.</p>
<p>If not a specific design, you can also make some wall murals for your room to give you the aesthetic feel you wish to have around.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Cupboards and furniture beautify your house and on the other hand, a false ceiling is the one that enhances the beauty of your abode. <strong>Pop ceiling designs</strong> enhance the look of your house and help in concealing all the electrical wires and ducting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Plaster of Paris, Gypsum board, Plywood, Wood, Glass, Metal, Synthetic Leather, and PVC are a few types of false ceiling. <strong>POP ceiling designs</strong> and Gypsum boards are the most favoured ones.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>POP ceiling designs or Gypsum?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let me catch you up with a few basic things about ceiling designs so that you could pick the design and material of the false ceiling of your choice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are two kinds of false ceilings that people usually go for<strong>, Pop ceiling designs</strong> and Gypsum. These are the preferred ones in residential houses.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The reason being, POP is a slurry material that can be fashioned into any shape you like. <strong>Pop</strong> is a powdered material mixed with water to create a slurry substance that is then applied on a mesh and is then left to dry. Well,<strong> the pop ceiling</strong> is the most preferred one for residential houses. <strong>Pop Ceiling Designs</strong> are preferred for living rooms due to the material’s flexibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gypsum False ceilings are rectangular sheets that are fixed together with joints. For a polished finish, it is recommended to laminate them. The disadvantage is, you cannot mould it into any shape of your liking. Also, if the joints are not adequately fixed, the final finish can be unpleasant.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Why are Pop ceiling designs better than other types?</strong></h2>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Pop ceiling designs</strong> are cost-effective.</li>
<li>Cracks are not easily formed in the Pop<strong> ceiling</strong> since the same material is used for joining.</li>
<li><strong>Pop ceiling designs</strong> also have good adhesion properties.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The longevity of <strong>Pop ceiling designs</strong> is more than Gypsum. And under normal circumstances, <strong>Pop Design for Living Room and Bedroom</strong> lasts for over 20 years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though it takes more time to install a <strong>Pop false ceiling</strong> since it involves time-consuming steps like preparing the material, applying it on the mesh, and drying usually takes up most of the time. However, <strong>the pop ceiling</strong> is highly durable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, Pop creates a lot of mess, and you might need to give your house a good wash after the installation is done.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gypsum boards are readily available, and fixing them is easier than POP material. Gypsum boards are fitted with wooden or iron frameworks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bottom Line, whether it is POP ceiling or Gypsum, even if you bought some best-quality materials, it takes skilled labour for excellent results. So don&#8217;t compromise on this part.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Why have a false ceiling?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Often, builders provide only a few electric points, so that&#8217;s where <strong>POP ceiling designs</strong> come to our rescue. You can have more lights fixed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ample overhead lighting with LEDs can replace the old school tube light look.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, you can have a variety of lights fixed. LED lights are the most common ones. They can be coupled with cove lights, recessed lights, or both to get a more elegant look. Also, overhead lighting spreads over a larger area as compared to tube lights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can have a variety of lights fixed. Well, white, yellow, and warm white lights are common ones used for maintaining ambience in the house.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lesser-known advantages of having Pop false ceiling designs. (Is it just for beautification?)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most people think that this is just for beautifying and adorning their abode. Well, it serves this purpose to the fullest, but there are several other reasons for you to go for it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Heat insulation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A false ceiling offers heat insulation since it is capable of trapping heat in summers. If your house has direct exposure to the sun and the slab gets too hot in summers, it is advisable to place thermocol or glass wool (preferably) between the actual ceiling and <strong>Pop false ceiling</strong>. This ideal structuring helps in maintaining the temperature.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Soundproofing</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It also helps in soundproofing your house to a certain extent. For example, external noises can be blocked.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Act as concealers</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pop ceiling</strong> helps in concealing the electrical wiring.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Improves energy efficiency</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Air volume is directly proportional to electric load, <strong>Pop ceiling</strong> reduces the air volume which helps in mitigating the utility bills.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Comparing the Pop Design For Living Room 2017 looks with Living Room Ceiling Design 2019&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier, people used to go for different and complicated living room ceiling designs, now <strong>simple Pop Designs for living</strong> rooms have gained popularity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, this is purely based on your preferences. We cannot speak for you, but we can give you an idea of trending <strong>Pop Ceiling Designs For Living Room</strong> and <strong>Pop Ceiling Design For Bedrooms</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pick a design that feels more inviting and unique. If you are a creative person, then you can go for circular or any other innovative shape.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to have a standard but elegant look, a rectangular shape is always an impeccable choice. Though it might seem simple, if customized with proper lighting, this gives your ceiling a contemporary and aesthetic look.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>For kids&#8217; room</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a child&#8217;s room, you can use your imagination and creativity. You can customize your kid’s room depending on your child&#8217;s preferences or taste in colours.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pop Design For Bedroom 2019</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>&#8220;Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication&#8221; -Leonardo da Vinci.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bedroom is meant to be cosy so keep it simple with uncomplicated designs, bordered by recessed lights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want an inexpensive but picture-perfect look, a simple gypsum board finish with beautiful wallpaper or patterned paint does the job.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want a royal look, you can have a chandelier hung from your ceiling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These days people are going for ceilings customized with wood as it gives a modern-century vibe. The ply box placed between the slab and the false ceiling holds the weight of the chandelier. So plan beforehand if you want to have one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most preferred colour is white but people sometimes go for beige and warm tone colours too.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cons of Pop ceiling</strong></h2>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>If expertly done with quality ceiling material, it won’t create any trouble. However, if not properly finished, you might find yourself living with pests.</li>
<li>The false ceiling is not as strong as your original ceiling. So we really can&#8217;t hang heavy things from the ceiling unless it is smartly constructed.</li>
<li>Not suitable for low-height ceilings. There should be a minimum gap of 11 feet or more since the <strong>Pop ceiling</strong> is to be brought down by 8 inches at least.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Why you should have a Pop false ceiling in your abode</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As I already mentioned, a <strong>Pop false ceiling</strong> essentially traps heat. If you live in a skyscraper, the sun directly hits the ceiling which increases the amount of heat entering the house. These <strong>Pop ceiling designs</strong> can help in reducing the heat and also they possess acoustic properties which help in cancelling unnecessary noises.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How to choose a proper Pop ceiling design?</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Your preferred design is the first choice.</li>
<li>Your budget</li>
<li>False ceiling is not the end of designing your ceiling. Remember, there will be hidden costs in surface finish, light fixtures and repairs.</li>
<li>Look for high-quality ceilings that have a long life and are much more durable. It is a harsh reality that people buy low-grade materials and pay more for their fixtures.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Myths about false ceiling</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Large area-More cost?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s not true that large surface areas require us to pay more for false ceilings. The point is, if you order in bulk, the cost is affordable. The larger the surface area, the lesser the cost per square foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Can&#8217;t Small houses have Pop Ceiling Designs?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People commonly think that the <strong>Pop ceiling </strong>makes their living rooms look cramped if they are small in size, but you can still have your false ceiling done in the borders with recessed lights and bring down the middle area by a few inches for levelling (3 inches down). Don&#8217;t go for too many levels of false ceiling if this is the case. This makes it feel like the roof is onto your head. Simple levelling gives your house a simple, cosy, and pleasant look.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Things to take care</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It doesn&#8217;t require any high maintenance but cleaning it once in a while is a good practice to follow. Don&#8217;t do it with water, though. Gypsum, false ceiling and water don&#8217;t go well with each other.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you have your pest control services done at your house, you can ask experts to clean the cove lighting and recessed lighting areas as well, along with the rest of the house.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Things to plan before installing a false ceiling</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have an interior designer on board, that&#8217;s great. They will take care of many things that you might face trouble dealing with. There is no harm in knowing the following things.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Design and layout</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Plan the layout and design. This includes knowing the number of LED lights you want to have, the number of fans, and their placement depending on where you plan to install a TV set and sofa set.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you wish to have a swing, you can&#8217;t hang the hook directly from the Pop ceiling. Instead, the hook is fixed in the slab and is brought down through the Pop ceiling. It&#8217;s a tedious process to redo the whole thing if you decide to have a swing after the entire process is finished.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Ask your friends and family.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If they have already done it in their house, you can get valuable insight from them and avoid the mistakes that they have made in the past.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The prices of the materials.</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pop ceilings</strong> can be purchased at the cost of ₹50 to ₹150 per square foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gypsum false ceilings are available in ₹75 per square foot price range to ₹150 per square foot. Plan accordingly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On an endnote, you probably have realized that to get a complete and warm look for your living room. <strong>Pop ceiling designs</strong> contribute more than any other decor in your house. So weigh the advantages and disadvantages of <strong>Pop ceiling designs</strong> for your living room and bedroom. Now you are just a step away from adding this beautiful decor piece to your room. This is your opportunity to turn your drawing-room into a piece of beautiful artwork.</p>

<p><em><strong>No matter how well-put-together a home is, there is always a cosy and special spot in our home which we call our own. Be it the balcony garden where we can relax and peacefully sip our coffee or a living room where we can chill and binge-watch in our pyjamas or a bedroom where we can just doze off, we all have our favourite spot in our home where we love to spend some quality time. Similarly, even Bollywood celebrities have a personal favourite spot in their ultra-luxurious abode? Let’s take a sneak peek into Bollywood celebrities&#8217; lavish and plush homes.</strong></em></p>



<h1 id="h-bhumi-pednekar-s-never-ending-love-for-balcony-gardens"><strong>Bhumi Pednekar’s Never-Ending Love for Balcony Gardens</strong></h1>



<p>It is rightly said, a home is not a place, it is a feeling. A home is a place where you feel warmth and cosiness. For Bhumi Pednekar, one of the top actresses in the industry today, the balcony garden is her favourite spot in her home. She shared this special feeling with Square Yards in an exclusive&nbsp;<em><strong><a href="https://www.squareyards.com/micro/meri-wali-home-story/">‘Meri Wali Home Story’&nbsp;</a></strong></em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=square+yards">video</a> as she unveiled the favourite spot in her abode which is pretty close to her heart.</p>



<p>Her inclination towards greenery and natural lighting makes it obvious and comes as no surprise that the balcony garden is very close to her heart.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="814" height="565" src="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-202.png" alt="Bhumi Pednekar's Love For Balcony Gardens" class="wp-image-29792" srcset="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-202.png 814w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-202-300x208.png 300w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-202-768x533.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 814px) 100vw, 814px" /><figcaption><strong><em>Source: Instagram</em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>Bhumi loves to pose for pictures in the balcony garden as the green space and sea-facing apartment makes everything aesthetically pleasing and picture-perfect. The actress believes in consuming organic and homegrown products which is why she has been cultivating tomatoes, chillies, brinjal, strawberry and many more veggies in her mini balcony garden. Watching vegetables and fruits grow a little every day adds joy to her mornings.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="662" height="503" src="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-205.png" alt="Bhumi Pednekar's love for cinema" class="wp-image-29793" srcset="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-205.png 662w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-205-300x228.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px" /><figcaption><strong><em>Source: Instagram</em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>The actress&#8217; love for all things cinema is also evident from the interiors of her home. You can spot her favourite movie posters on the wall that include Wonder Woman and Audrey Hepburn to name a few.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="934" height="485" src="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-207.png" alt="Bhumi Pednekar's living room" class="wp-image-29794" srcset="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-207.png 934w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-207-300x156.png 300w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-207-768x399.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 934px) 100vw, 934px" /><figcaption><strong><em>Source: Instagram</em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>The Grand chandelier hanging in Bhumi’s living room will steal your heart as it gives a royal and classic look to her abode.</p>



<h1><strong>All Hearts for Alia Bhatt’s Cosy Reading Nook! </strong><strong></strong></h1>



<p>Alia Bhatt’s glamorous life gives an impression that her home would be everything bling, ostentatious and shiny just like her lifestyle. However, her cosy abode oozes classiness and minimalism and is nothing short of home-goals for millennials and Gen-Z. The Pinterest-ready wall in Alia Bhatt’s all-white home, calmer tones and soothing lights tell a lot about her interest in vintage interiors. One can vouch that her abode is an absolute reflection of her personality and taste.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="530" height="560" src="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Lets-Find-Your-Dream-Home-_-Call-8010820000-_-Clicbrics-1.jpg" alt="Alia Bhatt's Cosy Reading Nook" class="wp-image-29811" srcset="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Lets-Find-Your-Dream-Home-_-Call-8010820000-_-Clicbrics-1.jpg 530w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Lets-Find-Your-Dream-Home-_-Call-8010820000-_-Clicbrics-1-284x300.jpg 284w" sizes="(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px" /><figcaption><strong><em>Source: Architectural Digest</em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>Alia Bhatt’s intricately detailed home is designed by the very talented Richa Bahl. The actress plush home is replete with photogenic, Instagram-worthy corners, but the star’s favourite spot is a cosy low-seating nook in the living room. In the same corner, the object that grabs one&#8217;s attention is the bookshelf. It is adorned with quirky lamps, planters and some big books and another stand-out are the huge wall-size windows that give out a beautiful view of Mumbai’s tropical trees.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="772" height="498" src="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-209.png" alt="Bolywood Celebrities Home Entrance Interiors" class="wp-image-29796" srcset="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-209.png 772w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-209-300x194.png 300w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-209-768x495.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px" /><figcaption><strong><em>Source: Instagram</em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>The actress also has an affinity for the house&#8217;s entrance area as we can see it mirrors a perfect blend of old-world charm in New York-style interiors. To bring her apartment space alive, the entrance area comes with exposed white brick walls contrasted with art deco-style patterned green flooring. The monochromatic backdrop adorned with a black and white frame makes this spot ideal for actresses&#8217; OOTD photos.</p>



<h1><strong>Treasured Memory Wall in Ritesh and Genelia’s Abode</strong><strong></strong></h1>



<p>Most Bollywood celebrity homes mirror a distinctive vibe such as modern, vintage, minimalist, luxurious, or contemporary- but Ritesh and Genelia’s home falls under a category of its own. Ritesh being an architecture degree holder took over the charge to design his home. Tastefully done nooks at every turn reflects the style and personality of Ritesh. This Bollywood’s power couple’s home is nothing short of an architectural masterpiece that has well-balanced modern minimalist interiors and contrasting statement walls. Ritesh is a powerhouse of talent and definitely an artistic person whose piece of crazy artwork is adorned on a glass window.</p>



<p>Ritesh&#8217;s love for a well-lit home is quite evident as he prefers to keep the house all bright and shiny. Well, geometrically aligned lights are the highlight of their home.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="389" height="398" src="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-21-at-17.30.55-1-Copy.jpeg" alt="Ritesh and Genelia's Memory Wall" class="wp-image-29803" srcset="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-21-at-17.30.55-1-Copy.jpeg 389w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WhatsApp-Image-2020-08-21-at-17.30.55-1-Copy-293x300.jpeg 293w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></figure>



<p>The most favourite nook of their home is the <a href="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/riteish-and-genelias-memory-wall-wali-home-story">memory wall</a> as the duo believes in documenting raw memories. Their wall of memory gets a lot of attention and compliments as their life’s most nurtured <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=square+yards">special moments</a> are brought alive on a wall with the use of raw pictures.</p>



<h1><strong>Hrithik Roshan’s sea-facing bachelor pad is as stunning as he is&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></h1>



<p>Hrithik Roshan’s living area resonates soothing shades of blue and white and besides that his humongous living room gives a sprawling view of the skyline and sea. The design and colour palette of his home is inspired by the colours of the sea.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="940" height="650" src="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hrithik-Roshan-home-11.jpg" alt="Bollywood Celebrities Sea-Facing Living Room" class="wp-image-29799" srcset="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hrithik-Roshan-home-11.jpg 940w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hrithik-Roshan-home-11-300x207.jpg 300w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hrithik-Roshan-home-11-768x531.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /><figcaption><strong><em>Source: Architectural Digest </em></strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>The highlights and stand-outs of Roshan’s abode are quirky-one liners painted on walls, sea-inspired accents, monkey bars in the den, vending machine, grand piano in the living room and an in-house gaming zone.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="895" height="650" src="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hrithik-Roshan-at-home1.jpg" alt="Family Portrait Wall" class="wp-image-29800" srcset="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hrithik-Roshan-at-home1.jpg 895w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hrithik-Roshan-at-home1-300x218.jpg 300w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hrithik-Roshan-at-home1-768x558.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 895px) 100vw, 895px" /><figcaption><em><strong>Source: Architectural Digest</strong></em></figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the quirky spots in the actors abode is the wall that highlights a movable black grid with family portraits. An eye-catching 3D effect grid against the foreground of the ivory gives an overall touch of warmth to his abode.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="903" height="650" src="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hrithik-Roshan-at-home.jpg" alt="Hrithik Roshan's Favourite Den Area Spot" class="wp-image-29801" srcset="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hrithik-Roshan-at-home.jpg 903w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hrithik-Roshan-at-home-300x216.jpg 300w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hrithik-Roshan-at-home-768x553.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 903px) 100vw, 903px" /><figcaption><em><strong>Source: Architectural Digest</strong></em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The favourite and the most-loved spot where Hrithik and his kids spend most of their time is in the den area. Nothing is too fancy and extravagant about this nook, but fun and good times are definitely guaranteed there. The Den area comes with white-washed brick walls that are used at night to project movies, a billiards table, a chocolate vending machine and a foosball counter. Adjacent to the den area is an enclosed space that is an extension of the balcony that also shares the same sprawling and striking sea view.</p>
