Over the years, the trend depicts actors preferring Porsche and spacious residences for themselves. The fact that home is the place they spend most of the time apart from studios makes it worthwhile. Most Indian actors have proven to be spendthrifts when it comes to planning their abode. Similarly, the celeb home we are going to talk about here is the one owned by the famous south-Indian actor Allu Arjun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Allu Arjun&#8217;s house in Hyderabad is an expansive one and includes unmissable amenities. Well, this blog intends to take our readers on a journey to witness each aspect of the very famous celebrity home. From child-friendly corners to party corners, the house has it all. It is expansive in the sense that hardly is there any area where one would feel closely packed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-allu-arjun-s-journey\">Allu Arjun\u2019s Journey</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The south-Indian industry takes pride in beholding such great talents of all times. Allu Arjun has left no stone unturned in winning the hearts of fans. In the Telugu film industry, some of his famous hits include Naa Peru Surya, Ala Vaikunta Puram, and Naa Illu India. Initially, the actor resided with his family in a bungalow located in the Jubilee Hills region of Hyderabad. However, post his brother&#8217;s marriage, he shifted to the city&#8217;s outskirts, building his own house named &#8216;Blessing.&#8217;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">In his new modernized palace, the actor lives with his wife, Allu Sneha Reddy, an actor belonging to the same industry. The couple resides in the house with three significantly distinctive members. They are none other than their children Arha and Ayaan, also, not to miss out, Kazoku, their beloved pet dog. The residence is big enough to accommodate all its members and the luxuries they need. Also, the backyard is another part of the house that you can&#8217;t miss out on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-key-features-of-allu-arjun-s-home\">Key Features of Allu Arjun\u2019s Home</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Key-Features-of-Allu-Arjuns-Home.jpg\" alt=\"Key Features of Allu Arjun\u2019s Home\" class=\"wp-image-31275\" srcset=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Key-Features-of-Allu-Arjuns-Home.jpg 640w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Key-Features-of-Allu-Arjuns-Home-240x300.jpg 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><figcaption>Source: Instagram</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The distinctive part about the celebrity home is the structure that makes it stand out. It is a box-shaped house with all amenities inside it. Besides, there is a backyard that has been specially gifted to the junior Allu by his grandfather. The structuring and designing of the house were undertaken by a firm named Aamir &amp; Hameeda Associates, with Aamir Sharma being the designer himself. The circumscribing plot that the house was built on is nothing less than two acres in its measurement. As claimed by the designer, the actor wanted his house to be a &#8220;comfortable holiday home.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Keeping his specific requirements in mind, the house was designed just the right way. Today, architecture enthusiasts drool over the structuring and detailing of the Allu Arjun house. Taking note of the modern interiors alongside convenience, the major areas of the house have been kept connected to one another for easy access. Thus, one would find the kitchen, living room, dining area, and bar right close to one another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The overall design of the house is very minimalistic yet offers a classic modern-day look and feel. The corridor-like structure built right from the entrance leads to the living spaces. Very interestingly, an artificial grass-like pattern has been used by the designer in a wall that connects to the garden lying in the backyard of the house. Also, the swimming area holds a canopy owing to which the beautiful seating area is mostly under ignorance. Spread over 8000 Sq. Ft, the celebrity home in Hyderabad stands as a true elegance to witness.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-interesting-insights-about-allu-arjun-s-abode\">Interesting Insights About Allu Arjun\u2019s Abode</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"783\" src=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Interesting-Insights-About-Allu-Arjuns-Abode.jpg\" alt=\"Interesting Insights About Allu Arjun\u2019s Abode\" class=\"wp-image-31277\" srcset=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Interesting-Insights-About-Allu-Arjuns-Abode.jpg 640w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Interesting-Insights-About-Allu-Arjuns-Abode-245x300.jpg 245w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><figcaption>Source: Instagram</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">It would be surprising to hear that the celeb home is constructed out of low-maintenance materials. For example, epoxy cement has been used for the in-house flooring, linking kitchen, bar counters, and several shelves in the seating areas. However, the dining area is another point of attraction in the house. It is a cemented base topped with glass, backed by white ply benches. Moreover, the benches have been made moveable to fit into the outdoor vibe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Another specific attractive area is the bar counter. The area is coupled with bar tools in white color. On the hind side of the bar, there lies a very elegant piece of artefact which is not one. It holds a metal plank with nails on it, which functions as a bottle holder. To suit the whole minimalistic vibe of the house, its specific corners have been groomed with quirky accessories to add to the vibe and, in turn, make it look elegant.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-interiors-of-allu-arjun-house-key-facts\">Interiors of Allu Arjun House: Key Facts</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"788\" src=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Interiors-of-Allu-Arjun-House-Key-Facts.jpg\" alt=\"Interiors of Allu Arjun House Key Facts\" class=\"wp-image-31278\" srcset=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Interiors-of-Allu-Arjun-House-Key-Facts.jpg 640w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Interiors-of-Allu-Arjun-House-Key-Facts-244x300.jpg 244w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><figcaption>Source: Instagram</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The colors infused in each corner of the house are mostly neutrals or whites.</li><li>The house is built entirely on modern-day look and vibe</li><li>The spacious living room of the house depicts the choice of the couple</li><li>From cushions on the couch to certain other areas hold striped patterns</li><li>On the living room, one can find an ottoman with a diver too</li><li>All across the living room lies several wooden shelves with family portraits and pictures enclosed in glass</li><li>There are various seating areas in the house with a somewhat different vibe and feel.

There need to be some factors present for the kids to call it home. Hence, the property beholds a vibrant nursery where the kids have seen dwellings often. The junior Allu Ayaan has a mesmerizing bedroom to his credit. It beholds subtly vibrant colors such as white and pastel blue on its walls and other corners. There lies a white cabinet to store all his play items. The actor&#8217;s love for his kids as a father is truly depicted in his public posts.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">nother item in the room is a floating wall-like shelving structure that is meant for the kid to portray his collection so far. Besides, there lies a specific television room in the house where the kids are seen spending some relaxation time. The pool, the greenery, and the plant life all around the house are other interesting nooks for the kids. The family pictures on different parts of the house shared on various social media platforms depict the bonding that the family shares with the house.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-other-prized-possessions-owned-by-allu-arjun\">Other prized possessions owned by Allu Arjun</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The south-Indian actor has spent his hard-earned money to get himself the best of all. Furthermore, several other remarkable possessions are of high value for the actor. Though he has been spotted adorning himself in luxurious and expensive clothing, there is quite some other extra spending that the actor keeps a knack for. Let&#8217;s have a look at some of them:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-a-vanity-van\">A vanity van</h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">It is of no surprise that the actor owns a vanity van worth \u20b97 crores. He bought the vanity van in 2019 and named it &#8216;Falcon.&#8217; The interiors of the van are adorned in colors such as black, white, or silver. The van comprises certain symbolic features such as a giant mirror, leather seats, and many more. There is no doubt that the actor prefers style and elegance for all things equally.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-jaguar-xj-l\">Jaguar XJ L</h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The actor\u2019s possession of a customized vanity van brings forth his interest in vehicles. Similarly, he has invested \u20b91.2 crores in a Jaguar XJ L. The car offers a thundering speed of 250 km/hours and is accountable for one of the most spent items for Arjun Allu.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-range-rover-vogue\">Range rover vogue</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The actor&#8217;s love for cars seems never-ending. He has been a spendthrift in this regard. One of his Instagram posts with the car and the perfect caption portrays how much of a car lover he is. It cost him about \u20b91.88 crores to \u20b9 4.03 crores approx, and hence it is definitely on the list of his prized possessions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-volvo-xc90-t8-excellence\">Volvo XC90 T8 Excellence</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">It cost him about \u20b91.30-1.35 crore to get this beast. But, his love towards his beasts keeps adding to his collection. Nevertheless, his collection is something that most enthusiasts might be drooling over.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-wrapping-up\">Wrapping Up</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">A house is often regarded as something more than just a mere dwelling place. With that, the Allu Arjun House is a significant source of inspiration for many to build their castles on. It is one of the top houses on the outskirts of Hyderabad. The house is a typical example of modern-day elegance and class spread across quite an area. Every corner of the house beholds peaceful colors that complement the overall look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">From soft and subtle colors to amenities specifically for the kids, the property has all that to call home. It is one of the beautiful possessions for the Allu family that they take pride in. The designers have crafted it in such a way to fit into the desires of its clients rightly. No wonder why &#8216;Blessing&#8217; the house is truly a blessing in itself for the whole Allu family.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-you-might-also-like\">You Might Also Like</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-yoast-seo-related-links\"><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/bollywood-celebrities-on-a-home-buying-spree\">Bollywood Celebrities on a Home Buying Spree</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/ultimate-guide-false-ceiling-decor-ideas-for-kids-room\">The Ultimate Guide: False Ceiling D\u00e9cor Ideas For Kids\u2019 Room</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/a-sneak-peek-into-kapil-sharmas-homes-in-mumbai-and-punjab\">A Sneak Peek Into Kapil Sharma\u2019s Homes in Mumbai and Punjab</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/buying-a-home-in-bangalore-here-are-some-things-you-should-know\">Buying a home in Bangalore?

You may easily come across spectacular bungalows and extravagant flats with beautiful gardens and luxurious facilities that will astound anybody who passes by.

Rohit Shetty&#8217;s Mumbai house, named &#8220;Shetty Tower,&#8221; is reported to be Rohit Shetty&#8217;s dream house. The filmmaker of &#8220;Golmaal&#8221; had planned to develop a home in one of Mumbai&#8217;s finest areas for eleven years, and his hard work and commitment had finally paid off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every Bollywood fan knows Rohit Shetty&#8217;s passion for automobiles, and we have seen his blockbuster films feature a diverse range of vehicles. As a result, the filmmaker has decided to devote the first four levels of his 10-story celebrity mansion to his high-end vehicle collection. Lamborghini Urus, Maserati GT Sport, Ford Mustang GT (2016), Range Rover, and BMW 7-Series (earlier version) are among his premium vehicles. You should also be aware that Rohit Shetty enjoys customizing his automobiles. This is why most vehicles, like the Ford Mustang GT and Range Rover, have extra features and distinctive colours. Each of these vehicles would cost between 1.2 and 2 crores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first four and top two levels of Rohit Shetty&#8217;s house are allocated to his family and vehicles, while the other levels will be rented, according to people close to the filmmaker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another source close to Rohit Shetty told a leading weekly newspaper, &#8220;Rohit has a completely operational workplace with terrace-seating and a production house in Andheri and would not be relocating his workstation into the new tower.\u201d This is his new residence, where he lives with his mother, Ratna, his wife, Maya, and their son, Ishaan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rohit Shetty&#8217;s Mumbai residence was completed last year, and it has a large lawn as well as a high-end security cabin.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-a-brief-overview-of-shetty-tower-s-architecture\"><strong>A Brief Overview of Shetty Tower\u2019s Architecture</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Located on Hasya Kalakar Mehmood Chowk in Juhu, Shetty Tower stands tall over other structures and can easily be distinguished. The residence of Rohit Shetty is a wonderful example of contemporary architecture. He has designed his house in a simple yet appealing manner. The Shetty Tower is a structure that prioritizes utility and a clean aesthetic over ornamentation. The design style differs from that of more ornately adorned residences. The tower is strewn with sprawling verandahs on each floor and the same are embellished with plants. In a hectic metropolis like Mumbai, it is important that one&#8217;s house feels like a getaway, with adequate natural light and fresh air to breathe. Rohit Shetty&#8217;s abode meets all of these requirements. Owing to the multiple floor-to-ceiling glass doors installed on the verandahs, the filmmaker&#8217;s residence transforms into a sun-drenched bliss throughout the day. The house&#8217;s elegant appearance is enhanced by the sunshine pouring on it during the daytime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Shetty Tower also has a sprawling home garden inside, which contains diverse families of plants adding to the house&#8217;s appeal. Plants are also known to help with stress reduction, which might explain the reason for the ever so joyous look on Shetty&#8217;s face. Apart from the interiors, the exteriors are equally adorned with lush greenery, making the top half of the structure peep over the various trees. The house&#8217;s visually pleasing appearance is always enhanced by the modern architectural aspect combined with the natural surroundings. The general tone of the house is very well-coordinated, and all of the building&#8217;s components are interconnected in a way that adds to its charm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from the aforementioned amenities, the Shetty Tower also possesses the highest level of security. Emergency buzzers, intercoms, escape chute and top-of-the-line security installations guarantee the Shetty family a hassle-free life.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-celebrity-neighbors-of-rohit-shetty-celeb-homes-in-juhu\"><strong>Celebrity Neighbors of Rohit Shetty | Celeb Homes in Juhu</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Juhu has long been one of Mumbai&#8217;s affluent suburbs, and it is home to some of the city&#8217;s greatest superstars.

The director has acquired a 10-story property in Juhu, one of Mumbai&#8217;s most affluent neighborhoods. Juhu is a renowned neighborhood where several well-known celebrities have luxury houses. You may easily come across spectacular bungalows and extravagant flats with beautiful gardens and luxurious facilities that will astound anybody who passes by. Renowned Bollywood filmmaker, Rohit Shetty\u2019s house is one such luxurious example. Shetty\u2019s skyscraper was originally called Ishaan after his son, but now has a \u201cShetty Tower\u201d sign on the entrance.\n\n\n\nRohit Shetty Home: What\u2019s Inside This Luxurious Tower?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to sources, Rohit Shetty and his family have moved into the 10-story tower&#8217;s top two levels. Rohit Shetty&#8217;s Mumbai house, named &#8220;Shetty Tower,&#8221; is reported to be Rohit Shetty&#8217;s dream house. The filmmaker of &#8220;Golmaal&#8221; had planned to develop a home in one of Mumbai&#8217;s finest areas for eleven years, and his hard work and commitment had finally paid off.\n\n\n\nEvery Bollywood fan knows Rohit Shetty&#8217;s passion for automobiles, and we have seen his blockbuster films feature a diverse range of vehicles. As a result, the filmmaker has decided to devote the first four levels of his 10-story celebrity mansion to his high-end vehicle collection. Lamborghini Urus, Maserati GT Sport, Ford Mustang GT (2016), Range Rover, and BMW 7-Series (earlier version) are among his premium vehicles. You should also be aware that Rohit Shetty enjoys customizing his automobiles. This is why most vehicles, like the Ford Mustang GT and Range Rover, have extra features and distinctive colours. Each of these vehicles would cost between 1.2 and 2 crores.\n\n\n\nThe first four and top two levels of Rohit Shetty&#8217;s house are allocated to his family and vehicles, while the other levels will be rented, according to people close to the filmmaker.\n\n\n\nAnother source close to Rohit Shetty told a leading weekly newspaper, &#8220;Rohit has a completely operational workplace with terrace-seating and a production house in Andheri and would not be relocating his workstation into the new tower.\u201d This is his new residence, where he lives with his mother, Ratna, his wife, Maya, and their son, Ishaan.\n\n\n\nRohit Shetty&#8217;s Mumbai residence was completed last year, and it has a large lawn as well as a high-end security cabin.\n\n\n\nA Brief Overview of Shetty Tower\u2019s Architecture\n\n\n\nLocated on Hasya Kalakar Mehmood Chowk in Juhu, Shetty Tower stands tall over other structures and can easily be distinguished. The residence of Rohit Shetty is a wonderful example of contemporary architecture. He has designed his house in a simple yet appealing manner. The Shetty Tower is a structure that prioritizes utility and a clean aesthetic over ornamentation. The design style differs from that of more ornately adorned residences. The tower is strewn with sprawling verandahs on each floor and the same are embellished with plants. In a hectic metropolis like Mumbai, it is important that one&#8217;s house feels like a getaway, with adequate natural light and fresh air to breathe. Rohit Shetty&#8217;s abode meets all of these requirements. Owing to the multiple floor-to-ceiling glass doors installed on the verandahs, the filmmaker&#8217;s residence transforms into a sun-drenched bliss throughout the day. The house&#8217;s elegant appearance is enhanced by the sunshine pouring on it during the daytime.\n\n\n\nThe Shetty Tower also has a sprawling home garden inside, which contains diverse families of plants adding to the house&#8217;s appeal. Plants are also known to help with stress reduction, which might explain the reason for the ever so joyous look on Shetty&#8217;s face. Apart from the interiors, the exteriors are equally adorned with lush greenery, making the top half of the structure peep over the various trees. The house&#8217;s visually pleasing appearance is always enhanced by the modern architectural aspect combined with the natural surroundings. The general tone of the house is very well-coordinated, and all of the building&#8217;s components are interconnected in a way that adds to its charm.\n\n\n\nAside from the aforementioned amenities, the Shetty Tower also possesses the highest level of security. Emergency buzzers, intercoms, escape chute and top-of-the-line security installations guarantee the Shetty family a hassle-free life.\n\n\n\nCelebrity Neighbors of Rohit Shetty | Celeb Homes in Juhu\n\n\n\nJuhu has long been one of Mumbai&#8217;s affluent suburbs, and it is home to some of the city&#8217;s greatest superstars.

He, on the other hand, bounced back with renewed vigour and demonstrated his value to the world in the most effective manner imaginable.

            "content_html": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Widely known for her comic roles in Bollywood movies and being a judge on various comedy shows, Archana Puran Singh is a name that needs no introduction. Well, Singh and her actor-husband, Parmeet Sethi\u2019s majestic bungalow is gaining eye-balls and doing rounds on the Internet. Let us take a virtual tour of Archana Puran Singh House, beautifully designed Madh Island bungalow.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Archana Puran Singh is popular for being the judge on <em>The Kapil Sharma Show</em> and known for her jolly nature, both onscreen and offscreen. She has acted in some of the greatest A-listed Bollywood movies of all times, like Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Mohabbatein, Kick and Raja Hindustani. Singh has shared screen space with leading B-town actors, including Akshay Kumar, Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Amitabh Bachchan, Salman Khan and many others. She was also a part of the famous TV serial Shrimaan Shrimati.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While most Mumbaikars were locked up in their matchbox-sized apartments amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, Archana Puran Singh and Parmeet Sethi enjoyed spending some quality family time at their dreamy residence. However, the lockdown did not stop Archana from entertaining her fans. She kept her fans hooked to her Instagram handle by sharing adorable, funny pictures and videos of her family, housekeeping staff and pets. Along with that, we also got a close look at the lavish property owned by the couple that makes us completely mesmerised. Well, it sure made us envy them a bit, but looking at how hard they have worked in the entertainment industry for decades, they truly deserve all these luxuries. It is fair to say that even some of the greatest Bollywood celebrities cannot afford to have such a luxurious life as <strong>Archana Puran Singh</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What is the view from Archana Puran Singh House &amp; balcony?</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Kuch Kuch Hota Hai actress shared an Instagram video showing us the view from her balcony that is simply the star of her property. The view of refreshing lush greenery all around with high-rise buildings in the background is a treat to the eyes, and fans could not stop gushing over it. A closer look at her balcony view highlights the stunning white patio set, adding to the scenic beauty. Singh further mentions that she likes to enjoy her alone time sitting on her balcony and getting in some cool breeze when it is too hot to go outside.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Archana Puran Singh&#8217;s Lush Green Lawn</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Behind the Singh-Sethi&nbsp;bungalow, they have a lush garden with a plethora of plants and trees, vibrant flowers and benches. Singh shared a video showing Parmeet and her son spending quality time with their adorable dog named Drama in their beautiful garden. While Singh likes to sit, sip and chat with her 90-year-old mother, Sethi and the kids prefer to work it out hard in the stunning garden at the same time.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Plush Garden at Archana Puran Singh\u2019s Property</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Archana Puran Singh&nbsp;and&nbsp;Parmeet Sethi&nbsp;own a very spacious property that is no less than a resort. Their&nbsp;Madh Island&nbsp;residence has a wide and long walkway in the garden area filled with lovely lush green plants. The paved path is perfect for morning and evening walks. Singh also gave us a virtual tour of her beautiful garden through an Instagram post where she was seen walking around the lush garden accompanied by their cute dog, Drama. All we could think is, who would not like to reside here?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In some of Singh&#8217;s IG videos, we can see another small garden adjoining the lavish one. This garden seems to be devoted to growing vegetables, tomatoes, brinjal, capsicum, to name a few. Adding to that, Singh&#8217;s backyard is filled with trees of fruits like coconut, plum, papaya, mango, etc. It shows Singh and Sethi&#8217;s love and passion for gardening and nature. A glimpse of the fresh produce from their garden is seen in some of her videos.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Archana Puran Singh\u2019s Property: The Front Entrance</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Out of the many videos shared by&nbsp;Archana Puran Singh&nbsp;on her Instagram handle, one video shows a sneak peek of her stunning&nbsp;bungalow&nbsp;from outside. In this video, her mother was waving to her from the grand front stoop. It has a gated entrance with a huge doorway. The interiors seemed aesthetically pleasing and definitely well-lit with striking chandeliers. The stunning french windows and bougainvillaea plant give it a complete royal residence look.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&nbsp;A royal affair in the living room</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Archana Puran Singh&nbsp;and&nbsp;Parmeet Singh&#8217;s lavish&nbsp;bungalow<strong>&nbsp;</strong>has a mesmerising living room. Furnished with a white modish couch, trendy lights, and a centrally placed chandelier, Singh&#8217;s living room is what dreams are made of. Also, one cannot miss the mirrors on the walls and wall paintings in the background that add to the room&#8217;s royal aura.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Luxe Master Bedroom</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Archana Puran Singh&#8217;s fans get a glimpse of the luxurious and spacious master bedroom of her&nbsp;bungalow&nbsp;time and again through her IG videos. Singh&#8217;s bedroom gives classy Boho vibes with a simple pastel palette, clean, white cotton linen and a wicker-designed bed. The room decor shows the star&#8217;s love for subtle colours like white and baby pink. One of the videos where Singh&#8217;s domestic help, Bhagyashree, was in the limelight- the video highlighted the room&#8217;s beautifully done modern furniture like the bedroom chair and table set, recliner chair, artwork on the wall and the hanging lights. In another picture posted by Singh, we see her other canine friend &#8216;Patch&#8217; resting under the bed like a boss.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The actress left her fans spellbound with her meticulously modern designed room interior. Adorned with a comfy white L-shaped lounge sofa set, white mirrored closets behind it and beige coloured curtains, the room has an austere look. Adding to the room&#8217;s grandeur was the metallic gold furniture and door handles, a centrally placed stylish hanging ceiling lamp and the huge flatscreen TV mounted on the wall.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Lobby Area</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In one of the IG videos shared by Singh, we catch the cute banter between Bhagyashree and another member of the housekeeping staff, Raj. We also notice the beautiful lobby area just outside Singh and Sethi&#8217;s luxurious master bedroom. It has a formal table and revolving chair set-up. A notice board is also placed on the side, and it might be the space for work-related discussions. It leads to the staircase with a spandrel decorated with artistic paintings, comfy chairs and lamps, giving it a classy look altogether. The video also depicts the friendly relation Singh, and her family members have with their housekeeping staff.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What\u2019s the Buzz around their Pet Room?</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Recently,&nbsp;Archana Puran Singh&nbsp;posted a lovely Instagram picture where she introduced her fans to their two adorable pets, Patch and Drama, who love lounging around the royal bungalow. They were lazing around in a classic white and gold coloured room with pink-grey draping, white rugs and modern furniture. With an old school four-post wooden bed, a mounted wall TV set and a blue moving comfy recliner chair- is the perfect place to unwind at the end of a long day. Singh wanted to clear the misconception among her fans that her dogs do not have any place to chill inside their home. The picture shows Patch lazing on his cosy rug while Drama is literally chilling on the cold floor, licking and drooling all over. It shows the couple&#8217;s love for their pets.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Modular Kitchen</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Singh&#8217;s&nbsp;Madh Island residence has a huge kitchen space, as seen in one of her Instagram videos featuring Bhagyashree and her son. The kitchen area is as elegant as the rest of the bungalow, with white cabinets and round-patterned wall tiles. The ceiling lights highlight this space, and we cannot get our eyes off them. The area is spacious enough, allowing proper air circulation with a designed kitchen chimney. It also has a small TV mounted on the wall to keep them entertained while cooking.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Instagram-Worthy Home D\u00e9cor</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Along with their acting skills, the Singh-Sethi couple also seems to have a good eye for design and architecture, as seen from the nook and corners of their&nbsp;Madh Island property. The interiors of their house are as wonderful and beautiful as the garden outside. In one of the videos shared by Singh, where she thanked her fans for their love, support and positivity, we caught a glimpse of her stunning interiors with a mix of subtle colours. The soft baby pink and grey curtains, the beautiful lampshade by her side and the white vase with lovely pink flowers compliment each other well and give the room a serene look. Singh further mentioned how she does not mind being called old and takes it very casually.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Archana Puran Singh Family: Sharing Festive Vibes</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In another IG video posted during Diwali, we see Singh celebrate and share some cheerful moments with Parmeet, her mother, her sons and the housekeeping staff at their lavish abode. Adding to the completely classy look is the stylish wall lamp, beige sofa set, large windows with flowy white curtains and the big artwork in the background.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Singh-Sethi Couple like to Keep it Cool</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As&nbsp;Madh Island is too close to the sea, the Singh-Sethi residence might be humid during summers. To counter this, Archana and Parmeet try to maintain a cosy, easy-breezy and serene set-up at their place. The dream house is perfectly balanced with whites, powder blue and just the right accents of gold. We also notice several houseplants at the celebrity&#8217;s bungalow that help maintain the cool.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Movie Nights at Archana Puran Singh&#8217;s Posh Abode</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of Singh&#8217;s Instagram posts shows the huge flatscreen TV mounted on the wall.&nbsp;Archana Puran Singh&#8217;s family&nbsp;probably chills here together during a movie night. The all-white TV bench paired with the golden-white wall lamp gives it a complete royal look.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Singh-Sethi&nbsp;bungalow<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is a class apart with loads of classic white upholstery and furnishing and no loud colour, giving a royal look throughout. Maintaining such an enormous property with eye-catching interiors would most definitely be difficult, but the couple has proved to do a tremendous job at it. Singh and Sethi&#8217;s plush&nbsp;Madh Island&nbsp;property has aced the residence game undoubtedly and has given us some major house goals. Living at such a majestic and luxurious residence would be a dream come true for many of us.</p>\n<h2>FAQs</h2>\n\n        <section class=\"sc_fs_faq sc_card\">\n            <div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>How old is Archana Puran Singh?</h2>                <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tArchana Puran Singh was born on 26 September 1962 in Dehradun and is 58 years old.                    </p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </section>\n\t        <section class=\"sc_fs_faq sc_card\">\n            <div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>How many children do Archana Puran Singh and Parmeet Sethi have?</h2>                <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tArchana Puran Singh and Parmeet Sethi have two sons named Ayushmann Sethi and Aaryamann Sethi.                    </p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </section>\n\t        <section class=\"sc_fs_faq sc_card\">\n            <div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>How much is Parmeet Sethi\u2019s net worth?</h2>                <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tParmeet Sethi\u2019s net worth was around 1 million to 5 million dollars during 2019.                    </p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </section>\n\t        <section class=\"sc_fs_faq sc_card\">\n            <div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>What does Parmeet Sethi do?</h2>                <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tParmeet Sethi has acted in several Bollywood hits, from Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) to Dil Dhadakne Do (2015).

Singh shared a video showing Parmeet and her son spending quality time with their adorable dog named Drama in their beautiful garden. While Singh likes to sit, sip and chat with her 90-year-old mother, Sethi and the kids prefer to work it out hard in the stunning garden at the same time.\nPlush Garden at Archana Puran Singh\u2019s Property\nArchana Puran Singh&nbsp;and&nbsp;Parmeet Sethi&nbsp;own a very spacious property that is no less than a resort. Their&nbsp;Madh Island&nbsp;residence has a wide and long walkway in the garden area filled with lovely lush green plants. The paved path is perfect for morning and evening walks. Singh also gave us a virtual tour of her beautiful garden through an Instagram post where she was seen walking around the lush garden accompanied by their cute dog, Drama. All we could think is, who would not like to reside here?\nIn some of Singh&#8217;s IG videos, we can see another small garden adjoining the lavish one. This garden seems to be devoted to growing vegetables, tomatoes, brinjal, capsicum, to name a few. Adding to that, Singh&#8217;s backyard is filled with trees of fruits like coconut, plum, papaya, mango, etc. It shows Singh and Sethi&#8217;s love and passion for gardening and nature. A glimpse of the fresh produce from their garden is seen in some of her videos.\nArchana Puran Singh\u2019s Property: The Front Entrance\nOut of the many videos shared by&nbsp;Archana Puran Singh&nbsp;on her Instagram handle, one video shows a sneak peek of her stunning&nbsp;bungalow&nbsp;from outside. In this video, her mother was waving to her from the grand front stoop. It has a gated entrance with a huge doorway. The interiors seemed aesthetically pleasing and definitely well-lit with striking chandeliers. The stunning french windows and bougainvillaea plant give it a complete royal residence look.\n&nbsp;A royal affair in the living room\nArchana Puran Singh&nbsp;and&nbsp;Parmeet Singh&#8217;s lavish&nbsp;bungalow&nbsp;has a mesmerising living room. Furnished with a white modish couch, trendy lights, and a centrally placed chandelier, Singh&#8217;s living room is what dreams are made of. Also, one cannot miss the mirrors on the walls and wall paintings in the background that add to the room&#8217;s royal aura.\nLuxe Master Bedroom\nArchana Puran Singh&#8217;s fans get a glimpse of the luxurious and spacious master bedroom of her&nbsp;bungalow&nbsp;time and again through her IG videos. Singh&#8217;s bedroom gives classy Boho vibes with a simple pastel palette, clean, white cotton linen and a wicker-designed bed. The room decor shows the star&#8217;s love for subtle colours like white and baby pink. One of the videos where Singh&#8217;s domestic help, Bhagyashree, was in the limelight- the video highlighted the room&#8217;s beautifully done modern furniture like the bedroom chair and table set, recliner chair, artwork on the wall and the hanging lights. In another picture posted by Singh, we see her other canine friend &#8216;Patch&#8217; resting under the bed like a boss.\nThe actress left her fans spellbound with her meticulously modern designed room interior. Adorned with a comfy white L-shaped lounge sofa set, white mirrored closets behind it and beige coloured curtains, the room has an austere look. Adding to the room&#8217;s grandeur was the metallic gold furniture and door handles, a centrally placed stylish hanging ceiling lamp and the huge flatscreen TV mounted on the wall.\nThe Lobby Area\nIn one of the IG videos shared by Singh, we catch the cute banter between Bhagyashree and another member of the housekeeping staff, Raj. We also notice the beautiful lobby area just outside Singh and Sethi&#8217;s luxurious master bedroom. It has a formal table and revolving chair set-up. A notice board is also placed on the side, and it might be the space for work-related discussions. It leads to the staircase with a spandrel decorated with artistic paintings, comfy chairs and lamps, giving it a classy look altogether. The video also depicts the friendly relation Singh, and her family members have with their housekeeping staff.\nWhat\u2019s the Buzz around their Pet Room?\nRecently,&nbsp;Archana Puran Singh&nbsp;posted a lovely Instagram picture where she introduced her fans to their two adorable pets, Patch and Drama, who love lounging around the royal bungalow. They were lazing around in a classic white and gold coloured room with pink-grey draping, white rugs and modern furniture. With an old school four-post wooden bed, a mounted wall TV set and a blue moving comfy recliner chair- is the perfect place to unwind at the end of a long day. Singh wanted to clear the misconception among her fans that her dogs do not have any place to chill inside their home. The picture shows Patch lazing on his cosy rug while Drama is literally chilling on the cold floor, licking and drooling all over. It shows the couple&#8217;s love for their pets.\nThe Modular Kitchen\nSingh&#8217;s&nbsp;Madh Island residence has a huge kitchen space, as seen in one of her Instagram videos featuring Bhagyashree and her son. The kitchen area is as elegant as the rest of the bungalow, with white cabinets and round-patterned wall tiles. The ceiling lights highlight this space, and we cannot get our eyes off them. The area is spacious enough, allowing proper air circulation with a designed kitchen chimney. It also has a small TV mounted on the wall to keep them entertained while cooking.\nInstagram-Worthy Home D\u00e9cor\nAlong with their acting skills, the Singh-Sethi couple also seems to have a good eye for design and architecture, as seen from the nook and corners of their&nbsp;Madh Island property. The interiors of their house are as wonderful and beautiful as the garden outside. In one of the videos shared by Singh, where she thanked her fans for their love, support and positivity, we caught a glimpse of her stunning interiors with a mix of subtle colours. The soft baby pink and grey curtains, the beautiful lampshade by her side and the white vase with lovely pink flowers compliment each other well and give the room a serene look. Singh further mentioned how she does not mind being called old and takes it very casually.\nArchana Puran Singh Family: Sharing Festive Vibes\nIn another IG video posted during Diwali, we see Singh celebrate and share some cheerful moments with Parmeet, her mother, her sons and the housekeeping staff at their lavish abode. Adding to the completely classy look is the stylish wall lamp, beige sofa set, large windows with flowy white curtains and the big artwork in the background.\nThe Singh-Sethi Couple like to Keep it Cool\nAs&nbsp;Madh Island is too close to the sea, the Singh-Sethi residence might be humid during summers. To counter this, Archana and Parmeet try to maintain a cosy, easy-breezy and serene set-up at their place. The dream house is perfectly balanced with whites, powder blue and just the right accents of gold. We also notice several houseplants at the celebrity&#8217;s bungalow that help maintain the cool.\nMovie Nights at Archana Puran Singh&#8217;s Posh Abode\nOne of Singh&#8217;s Instagram posts shows the huge flatscreen TV mounted on the wall.&nbsp;Archana Puran Singh&#8217;s family&nbsp;probably chills here together during a movie night. The all-white TV bench paired with the golden-white wall lamp gives it a complete royal look.\nThe Singh-Sethi&nbsp;bungalow&nbsp;is a class apart with loads of classic white upholstery and furnishing and no loud colour, giving a royal look throughout. Maintaining such an enormous property with eye-catching interiors would most definitely be difficult, but the couple has proved to do a tremendous job at it. Singh and Sethi&#8217;s plush&nbsp;Madh Island&nbsp;property has aced the residence game undoubtedly and has given us some major house goals. Living at such a majestic and luxurious residence would be a dream come true for many of us.\nFAQs\n\n        \n            \n\t\t\t\tHow old is Archana Puran Singh?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tArchana Puran Singh was born on 26 September 1962 in Dehradun and is 58 years old.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tHow many children do Archana Puran Singh and Parmeet Sethi have?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tArchana Puran Singh and Parmeet Sethi have two sons named Ayushmann Sethi and Aaryamann Sethi.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tHow much is Parmeet Sethi\u2019s net worth?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tParmeet Sethi\u2019s net worth was around 1 million to 5 million dollars during 2019.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhat does Parmeet Sethi do?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tParmeet Sethi has acted in several Bollywood hits, from Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) to Dil Dhadakne Do (2015).

            "content_html": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Hyderabad</span></strong><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">, the city of pearls, was made the hub of the Telugu film industry in the early 1990s. As a result, all the prestigious studios of Tollywood, actors, actresses, etc., made this city their home. In addition, big names like Prabhas, Vijay Deverkonda, Mahesh Babu, Samantha Akkineni, etc., made\u00a0<strong>Hyderabad\u00a0</strong>their residing place. All these\u00a0<strong>celebrity homes in Hyderabad</strong>\u00a0are majorly found in\u00a0<strong>Jubilee Hills</strong>, one of the posh localities for the &#8216;<strong>Hyderabad property</strong>&#8216; catalogs.</span><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">When we are discussing the\u00a0<strong>celebrity homes in Hyderabad</strong>, the one house that cannot miss our eyes is the palatial house of Mahesh Babu and Namrata Shirodkar in\u00a0<strong>Jubilee Hills</strong>. It&#8217;s grand, luxurious, speaks of comfort, space, and is nothing short of a dream. So, let&#8217;s have a virtual tour of the house and soothe our eyes as we go along, and perhaps, take some notes for our future dream house!</span><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Mahesh Babu Home:</span></strong><strong><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\u00a0</span></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Ghattamaneni Mahesh Babu is undeniably one of the most famous and sought-after actors in Tollywood. He is immensely talented and has been active since 1979 in the Telugu film industry. Thanks to his good looks, he is referred to as the \u2018Prince\u2019 of the Telugu film industry. Having been considered one of the best actors, he is highly paid and so when we are discussing his house, we shouldn\u2019t be expecting anything less.</span><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">One of the luxurious houses in\u00a0<strong>Jubilee Hills, Hyderabad</strong>, is owned by the\u00a0<strong>Mahesh Babu family</strong>. The exteriors of the house are surely jaw-dropping. It is subtle but grand in look with white and grey walls and door-size sliding glass balcony windows. It matches well with the lush green garden on one side and a parking space on the other side.</span><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">This\u00a0<strong>Hyderabad property\u00a0</strong>has an indoor swimming pool, open spaces, a cozy study room, gymnasium, green gardens, a private office for Mahesh. In addition, the actor and his wife, Namrata Shirodkar, have customized other spots in the house like the living room, the puja room, the children&#8217;s room, etc., according to the tastes of the family.\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Every corner of the house screams luxury and comfort. What makes it best? Every element is quite subtle and soothing. We don&#8217;t see bright or vibrant colours inside the house. Shades of beige, brown, white, etc., dominate the walls, furniture, etc., but they are well contrasted yet matched with each other.\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Mahesh Babu Family:</span></strong><strong><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\u00a0</span></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Mahesh Babu is the son of a Telugu actor and director, Krishna. Carrying on his father&#8217;s legacy, Mahesh started acting in films from childhood and has been loved as an actor since then. He met Namrata Shirodkar on one of the film sets in 2000, and after dating for a couple of years, they got married in 2005. Since then, the duo has been setting couple-goals. Amidst their ambitious career, they have remained loyal and dedicated to each other and have succeeded in building up a luxurious life for themselves. They are doting parents to a son, and a daughter, and their family is strongly bound by love, culture, and laughter. The family also includes two pet dogs \u2013 Nubo and Pluto.\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">As they all are avid social media users, they keep dropping snaps from bits and corners of the house. Thanks to the pets, we get a clear view of the open garden in the house. The lush green grass is well synchronized with the trees and plants of different shapes and sizes. Sitting arrangements are made on one side of the garden. The floor is laid with grey wooden planks. There is a white marble table in the center which is surrounded by matching white sofa sets. The whole arrangement stands in perfect contrast to the dark green trees in the background.</span><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">In another snap, we see a different sitting arrangement by the side of the garden. The flooring is the same, but we see wooden plank benches. This again matches well with the lush green background. Varieties of plants and trees find their space in the garden, and hence, together, they put up a beautiful background with different shades of green. It is the best play area for the pets and the children, but it could also be a perfect tea spot for the family on a cozy evening.</span><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Mahesh Babu Kids:</span></strong><strong><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\u00a0</span></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Mahesh Babu and Namrata Shirodkar have been blessed with a son, Gautam Ghattamaneni, and a daughter, Sitara Ghattamaneni. The kids have doting parents, and they seem to enjoy all the love and attention showered on them. Mahesh Babu and Namrata Shirodkar, through their love for their children, multiply the comfort and protection of their house in their lives.</span><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">In a few photos of Mahesh and Namrata with their kids, we get glimpses of their house. In a snap, which seems like one corner of the living room, there is a huge glass window with white curtains. There is a one-seater brown leather sofa just in front of the window. A wooden cabinet behind the couch and the shade of wood match the shade of the leather. The floor is wooden, again matching the shade of the cabinet and the sofa. To bring out a contrasting effect, there is a light brown carpet on the floor. The carpet successfully breaks the monotony of the browns and also matches with the curtain behind.</span><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">A huge glass wall shields the entrance from the garden into the house, and this area has another sitting arrangement overlooking the garden. There are small center tables in black which are surrounded by easy chairs of a light brown shade. There is another sofa set with brown arm-rests and ash grey cushions. They look super comfortable and would make anyone want to sink into them on a windy evening.</span><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">The children&#8217;s room is going to make every child envy Gautam and Sitara. Disney characters are painted on the wall with a white bed standing in perfect contrast to the wall. The curtains in the room are printed in different colours, and they match the colourful characters on the wall. The bed, on the other hand, matches the rest of the walls in the room. All in all, the children&#8217;s section is colourful and beautifully coordinated with each other.</span><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Mahesh and Namrata spend a lot of time with their children. The area where Mahesh plays video games with his son is spacious. It gives a broader view of the hallway. There is a TV on a dark chocolate colour cabinet. The floor is again wooden. Other doors in the house are all of the same dark chocolate colour. But for a change, pink colour sofas are present in this area. Surprisingly, they don&#8217;t look out of place. Rather they enhance the beauty of the area.</span><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">The swimming pool overlooks the garden through a glass window. It has stairs leading into it on the opposite end. The wall above the pool is grey, and the lighting is subtle, which makes the water in the pool shine and look brighter.</span><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Namrata Shirodkar family:</span></strong><strong><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\u00a0</span></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Namrata was born in a Marathi-speaking family, but she became famous for some of her roles in Bollywood. She quit acting because she wanted to marry Mahesh Babu and she is a proud mother and an excellent wife.</span><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">She gave glimpses of the puja room in the house. It is small but well-lit and spaced out. There is a white marble temple against a golden wall. On either side of the temple are glass windows overlooking the outer spaces. The floor is white too, and it serves well with the purpose of the place, adding to the serenity and peace.</span><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">As Gautam and Sitara celebrated their birthdays, Namrata gave glimpses of some other corners of the house. Where the table is golden, the walls are decorated with paintings. The chairs are beige. The floor and walls are white. The hall is subtly lit with golden lights, which creates a beautiful ambience. To break the monotony of the whites and beige, all the doors and painting frames are dark chocolate.</span><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Memories are an essential part of human lives. Therefore, having a memory wall in a house is fair. The memory wall in Mahesh and Namrata&#8217;s house is white. It has a good number of photo frames. There is a double seater black sofa just in front of the memory wall on a light printed carpet. This is the best place in the house to relax and reminisce about the good old times.</span><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Namrata Shirodkar Property:</span></strong><strong><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\u00a0</span></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">The combined net worth of Mahesh Babu and Namrata Shirodkar is approximately 100 crores. It boosts their king-size living. The working space in the house is appropriate for a working environment, with a white table and a matching white working chair. The setup stands in contrast to the dark brown cabinet in the background, a perfect place for storing books and files.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Reading is for everyone. Comfortable reading space is what facilitates good reading habits. The reading space in this house of\u00a0<strong>Jubilee Hills</strong>\u00a0has a comfortable grey-coloured sofa with a small side table. The cushions, the side table, and the cabinet behind are in different shades of brown and black, while the wall behind is olive green.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">The living room is of utmost importance in every house. Not to mention again, but the living room of Mahesh and Namrata\u2019s house is luxurious, cozy, and well-designed. The home theatre is set against a light shade of wallpaper and the cabinet is a dark shade of brown, while the floor is a light shade of brown. There is a printed carpet on the floor and the sofa set is in the shade of beige which mixes well with the ambience.\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><u><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Other corners in the property</span></u><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">:</span></strong><strong><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\u00a0</span></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Fitness is important, and hence, the gymnasium is well-equipped with all the necessary machines for home-workout. There is a huge television on one wall. Another wall has a poster of Mahesh Babu with an inspirational quote written. It is well-lit and overlooks the outer space through a glass window again.\u00a0</span><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">The sofa, the couch, the walls, and the carpet are all in the shades of beige. To break the monotony, a dark coloured center table is present, along with brightly printed cushions.</span><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">There is another open space inside the house that looks like a division between two house sections. The floor is marbled. There are plants on both sides of the space. The two sections of the house are connected by a bridge that overlooks the marble floor beneath.

            "content_text": "Hyderabad, the city of pearls, was made the hub of the Telugu film industry in the early 1990s. As a result, all the prestigious studios of Tollywood, actors, actresses, etc., made this city their home. In addition, big names like Prabhas, Vijay Deverkonda, Mahesh Babu, Samantha Akkineni, etc., made\u00a0Hyderabad\u00a0their residing place. All these\u00a0celebrity homes in Hyderabad\u00a0are majorly found in\u00a0Jubilee Hills, one of the posh localities for the &#8216;Hyderabad property&#8216; catalogs.\u00a0\nWhen we are discussing the\u00a0celebrity homes in Hyderabad, the one house that cannot miss our eyes is the palatial house of Mahesh Babu and Namrata Shirodkar in\u00a0Jubilee Hills. It&#8217;s grand, luxurious, speaks of comfort, space, and is nothing short of a dream. So, let&#8217;s have a virtual tour of the house and soothe our eyes as we go along, and perhaps, take some notes for our future dream house!\u00a0\nMahesh Babu Home:\u00a0\nGhattamaneni Mahesh Babu is undeniably one of the most famous and sought-after actors in Tollywood. He is immensely talented and has been active since 1979 in the Telugu film industry. Thanks to his good looks, he is referred to as the \u2018Prince\u2019 of the Telugu film industry. Having been considered one of the best actors, he is highly paid and so when we are discussing his house, we shouldn\u2019t be expecting anything less.\u00a0\nOne of the luxurious houses in\u00a0Jubilee Hills, Hyderabad, is owned by the\u00a0Mahesh Babu family. The exteriors of the house are surely jaw-dropping. It is subtle but grand in look with white and grey walls and door-size sliding glass balcony windows. It matches well with the lush green garden on one side and a parking space on the other side.\u00a0\nThis\u00a0Hyderabad property\u00a0has an indoor swimming pool, open spaces, a cozy study room, gymnasium, green gardens, a private office for Mahesh. In addition, the actor and his wife, Namrata Shirodkar, have customized other spots in the house like the living room, the puja room, the children&#8217;s room, etc., according to the tastes of the family.\u00a0\u00a0\nEvery corner of the house screams luxury and comfort. What makes it best? Every element is quite subtle and soothing. We don&#8217;t see bright or vibrant colours inside the house. Shades of beige, brown, white, etc., dominate the walls, furniture, etc., but they are well contrasted yet matched with each other.\u00a0\u00a0\nMahesh Babu Family:\u00a0\nMahesh Babu is the son of a Telugu actor and director, Krishna. Carrying on his father&#8217;s legacy, Mahesh started acting in films from childhood and has been loved as an actor since then. He met Namrata Shirodkar on one of the film sets in 2000, and after dating for a couple of years, they got married in 2005. Since then, the duo has been setting couple-goals. Amidst their ambitious career, they have remained loyal and dedicated to each other and have succeeded in building up a luxurious life for themselves. They are doting parents to a son, and a daughter, and their family is strongly bound by love, culture, and laughter. The family also includes two pet dogs \u2013 Nubo and Pluto.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs they all are avid social media users, they keep dropping snaps from bits and corners of the house. Thanks to the pets, we get a clear view of the open garden in the house. The lush green grass is well synchronized with the trees and plants of different shapes and sizes. Sitting arrangements are made on one side of the garden. The floor is laid with grey wooden planks. There is a white marble table in the center which is surrounded by matching white sofa sets. The whole arrangement stands in perfect contrast to the dark green trees in the background.\u00a0\nIn another snap, we see a different sitting arrangement by the side of the garden. The flooring is the same, but we see wooden plank benches. This again matches well with the lush green background. Varieties of plants and trees find their space in the garden, and hence, together, they put up a beautiful background with different shades of green. It is the best play area for the pets and the children, but it could also be a perfect tea spot for the family on a cozy evening.\u00a0\nMahesh Babu Kids:\u00a0\nMahesh Babu and Namrata Shirodkar have been blessed with a son, Gautam Ghattamaneni, and a daughter, Sitara Ghattamaneni. The kids have doting parents, and they seem to enjoy all the love and attention showered on them. Mahesh Babu and Namrata Shirodkar, through their love for their children, multiply the comfort and protection of their house in their lives.\u00a0\nIn a few photos of Mahesh and Namrata with their kids, we get glimpses of their house. In a snap, which seems like one corner of the living room, there is a huge glass window with white curtains. There is a one-seater brown leather sofa just in front of the window. A wooden cabinet behind the couch and the shade of wood match the shade of the leather. The floor is wooden, again matching the shade of the cabinet and the sofa. To bring out a contrasting effect, there is a light brown carpet on the floor. The carpet successfully breaks the monotony of the browns and also matches with the curtain behind.\u00a0\nA huge glass wall shields the entrance from the garden into the house, and this area has another sitting arrangement overlooking the garden. There are small center tables in black which are surrounded by easy chairs of a light brown shade. There is another sofa set with brown arm-rests and ash grey cushions. They look super comfortable and would make anyone want to sink into them on a windy evening.\u00a0\nThe children&#8217;s room is going to make every child envy Gautam and Sitara. Disney characters are painted on the wall with a white bed standing in perfect contrast to the wall. The curtains in the room are printed in different colours, and they match the colourful characters on the wall. The bed, on the other hand, matches the rest of the walls in the room. All in all, the children&#8217;s section is colourful and beautifully coordinated with each other.\u00a0\nMahesh and Namrata spend a lot of time with their children. The area where Mahesh plays video games with his son is spacious. It gives a broader view of the hallway. There is a TV on a dark chocolate colour cabinet. The floor is again wooden. Other doors in the house are all of the same dark chocolate colour. But for a change, pink colour sofas are present in this area. Surprisingly, they don&#8217;t look out of place. Rather they enhance the beauty of the area.\u00a0\nThe swimming pool overlooks the garden through a glass window. It has stairs leading into it on the opposite end. The wall above the pool is grey, and the lighting is subtle, which makes the water in the pool shine and look brighter.\u00a0\nNamrata Shirodkar family:\u00a0\nNamrata was born in a Marathi-speaking family, but she became famous for some of her roles in Bollywood. She quit acting because she wanted to marry Mahesh Babu and she is a proud mother and an excellent wife.\u00a0\nShe gave glimpses of the puja room in the house. It is small but well-lit and spaced out. There is a white marble temple against a golden wall. On either side of the temple are glass windows overlooking the outer spaces. The floor is white too, and it serves well with the purpose of the place, adding to the serenity and peace.\u00a0\nAs Gautam and Sitara celebrated their birthdays, Namrata gave glimpses of some other corners of the house. Where the table is golden, the walls are decorated with paintings. The chairs are beige. The floor and walls are white. The hall is subtly lit with golden lights, which creates a beautiful ambience. To break the monotony of the whites and beige, all the doors and painting frames are dark chocolate.\u00a0\nMemories are an essential part of human lives. Therefore, having a memory wall in a house is fair. The memory wall in Mahesh and Namrata&#8217;s house is white. It has a good number of photo frames. There is a double seater black sofa just in front of the memory wall on a light printed carpet. This is the best place in the house to relax and reminisce about the good old times.\u00a0\nNamrata Shirodkar Property:\u00a0\nThe combined net worth of Mahesh Babu and Namrata Shirodkar is approximately 100 crores. It boosts their king-size living. The working space in the house is appropriate for a working environment, with a white table and a matching white working chair. The setup stands in contrast to the dark brown cabinet in the background, a perfect place for storing books and files.\nReading is for everyone. Comfortable reading space is what facilitates good reading habits. The reading space in this house of\u00a0Jubilee Hills\u00a0has a comfortable grey-coloured sofa with a small side table. The cushions, the side table, and the cabinet behind are in different shades of brown and black, while the wall behind is olive green.\nThe living room is of utmost importance in every house. Not to mention again, but the living room of Mahesh and Namrata\u2019s house is luxurious, cozy, and well-designed. The home theatre is set against a light shade of wallpaper and the cabinet is a dark shade of brown, while the floor is a light shade of brown. There is a printed carpet on the floor and the sofa set is in the shade of beige which mixes well with the ambience.\u00a0\u00a0\nOther corners in the property:\u00a0\nFitness is important, and hence, the gymnasium is well-equipped with all the necessary machines for home-workout. There is a huge television on one wall. Another wall has a poster of Mahesh Babu with an inspirational quote written. It is well-lit and overlooks the outer space through a glass window again.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe sofa, the couch, the walls, and the carpet are all in the shades of beige. To break the monotony, a dark coloured center table is present, along with brightly printed cushions.\u00a0\nThere is another open space inside the house that looks like a division between two house sections. The floor is marbled. There are plants on both sides of the space. The two sections of the house are connected by a bridge that overlooks the marble floor beneath. But this area is again a good play space for the pets.\u00a0\nConclusion\u00a0\nWe keep getting glimpses of the house now and then through various social media posts. Every corner of the house is decorated beautifully. Nothing is vibrant, yet nothing is dull. This house uses a smart combination of lighting and colour contrasts to bring out a rich and luxurious look.\u00a0\nThe best thing is that every family member\u2019s requirements and tastes are met. If there is an office for the elders, then the children have their separate rooms. The entertainment section is kept separate from the video games section, hence no interruption to anyone. The reading space is there to preach knowledge, while the puja area is there to preach culture.\u00a0\u00a0\nWho would need anything else if there is an open garden with several comfortable sitting areas? It could fit any mood, weather, and it is surely the best hangout spot in the house.\nFAQs\n\n        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhat is the worth of Mahesh Babu\u2019s house in Jubilee Hills, Hyderabad?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tMahesh Babu and his wife Namrata Shirodkar\u2019s house is perhaps one of the best celebrity homes in Hyderabad, and its worth would be around 28 crores.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tIn which film\u2019s set did Mahesh Babu meet Namrata Shirodkar?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tMahesh Babu met Namrata Shirodkar on the sets of the film &#8216;Vaamsi&#8217; in the year 2000.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tHow many properties does Mahesh Babu own?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tApart from the house in Jubilee Hills, Mahesh Babu owns another property in Bangalore.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhat is Namrata Shirodkar best known for?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tNamrata is a brilliant actress and is known for her Bollywood films like &#8216;Vaastav&#8217;, &#8216;Pukar&#8217;, etc. She was also Femina Miss India in 1993.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tHow old are Gautam and Sitara Ghattamaneni?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tMahesh Babu and Namrata Shirodkar&#8217;s son, Gautam, was born in 2006 and is 14 years old, while Sitara was born in 2012 and is 12 years old.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t\n\n\nAlso read :\n\n\nRent vs. Buy- Which should you go for?Choosing the Best Colors for your AbodeWhat is the best furniture layout in a small living room?B&amp;W Monochrome Ideas to Decorate Your Home\nThe post A Tour Inside the Dreamlike Palatial House of Mahesh Babu and Namrata Shirodkar. appeared first on Real Estate News.",

            "content_html": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Nayanthara</strong> is one of the most coveted <strong>superstars</strong> in the South film industry. The Kollywood actress shot to fame with two successful movies Manassinakkare (2003) and Ayya (2005), as her debut in Malayalam and Tamil industry. Being at par with her beauty, her fans can be sure of being awestruck by her abode located in <strong>Hyderabad</strong>. <strong>Nayanthara\u2019s house</strong>, a high-end apartment, is no less than what one would expect from the famous <strong>celeb\u2019s home.</strong> Every detail in the house speaks volumes about this celebrity\u2019s style and majestic way of living. Though having passed her prime age, the actress does not shy away from breaking barriers, whether they are with respect to playing roles in female-centric movies to standing her ground regarding the gap in gender pay scale.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>A Star is Born </strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This superstar does not need an introduction. Her achievements speak for her hard work in the Kollywood film industry. The laurels that she has brought from a very young age are worth complimenting and genuinely impeccable.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The journey of a brown-haired Diana, who was the epitome of an average girl trying to fit into the world of stars to become <strong>Nayanthara</strong>, the Lady <strong>Superstar</strong> of the Kollywood industry, has made the entire south fan-following quite curious. <strong>Nayanthara</strong> was 19 years old when she entered the world of acting, and since then, nothing has stopped this <strong>superstar</strong> from achieving her dreams. She went on from working as a part time-model to being voted as the \u201cMost Desirable Woman in Chennai\u201d by a leading publisher in Southern India.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Born as Diana Mariam Kurian, the actress later changed her name to <strong>Nayanthara</strong> and converted to Hinduism. She started as a model in college and was the first runner up of Best Model Kerala in 2003. At that time, she was pursuing her bachelor&#8217;s degree in English Literature from Marthoma College, Thiruvalla. She was later on discovered by the director Satyan Athnikkad who gave her a prominent role in the Malayali film Manassinakkare in 2003. She appeared as a debutant in this movie, which turned out to be a blockbuster.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Having worked in more than 75 films in the Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam cinema, Nayanthara has earned a substantial fan following over the years. She is one of the few actresses who has worked with nearly all the leading actors in the Kollywood film industry. From Rajnikanth, Vijay Sethupathi to Dhanush, <strong>Nayanthara</strong> has worked with the best Kollywood actors and has maintained her spot, which is at the top, for nearly two decades.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Out of the 68 awards that <strong>Nayanthara</strong> has been nominated for, the talented actress has won 66 of them.\u00a0 Her exceptional work in Sri Rama Rajyam (2011) was highly appreciated and won her the Filmfare Award for Best Telugu Actress and the Nandi Award for Best Actress. In addition, the actress had won three Filmfare awards for her outstanding performance in three movies, each from Tamil, Malayalam, and Telugu cinema.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lesser Known Facts About Nayanthara\u2019s Life</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Also known as the Lady superstar, she has been a part of the 2018 Forbes India celebrity 100 list with an earning close to \u20b915.17 crores. Nayanthara has bagged the title of one of the highest-paid actresses in the South film Industry. Owing to her splendid performances, she charges approximately \u20b93 crores for each movie.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Nayanthara</strong> was initially raised as a Syrian Christian, but on August 7, 2011, the actress went through Shuddhi Karma, a procedure that consists of Vedic purification and chanting of Hymns from the Vedas and Gayatri Mantra.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another interesting fact about the south queen is that she is a polydactyl. She has a sixth finger on her hand, which is rudimentary, quite like the Bollywood star, Hrithik Roshan.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Nayanthara\u2019s Mystery Abode</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She does not have an account on any social media platform, keeping her private life all to herself. We seldom see pictures of <strong>Nayanthara</strong>&#8216;s magnificent house doing rounds, either. The actress believes in living in peace without much flaunting on social media. Yet her strong persona keeps the paparazzi on the run, always wanting a little more.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nayanthara has been all over the news for numerous reasons, one of them being her refusal to buy a permanent home in Chennai. She stated the reason behind this decision is nothing but security.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is believed that <strong>Nayanthara\u2019s house</strong> is located only in <strong>Hyderabad</strong>. Thus, the celebrity&#8217;s home is where she resides to gain solace and solitude. Considering Hyderabad to be where the celeb&#8217;s home belongs, she prefers to stay in hotels while shooting for films in Chennai.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Some interesting facts about Nayanthara\u2019s Home Decor</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Nayanthara\u2019</strong>s house reflects her radiant personality. From the Italian marble-laden shiny floors to the high ceiling, everything mirrors grandiose and luxury. Situated in Hyderabad, this celeb&#8217;s home has the most aesthetically pleasing home d\u00e9cor pieces and artefacts that seem to be handpicked from various places. The luxurious space has a broad and open look to it. Everything from the furniture to the tiniest bauble appears to be at the perfect spot, and every element of the house is no less beautiful than the other. The walls are primarily off-white with yellow ceiling lights to complement the d\u00e9cor. All the cushioning, including the couch and the chair covers, are of neutral tone colour. The actress has cherry-picked neutral and muted colours for the furniture too. The false ceiling and the LED lighting together give a very royal and chic look to the place.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Luxurious but Subtle</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The main seating area has elegant white sofas with contrasting cushions that speak of comfort yet luxury. To add to the exuberant lifestyle of the actor, her room is adorned with glass sculptures that add a touch of vibrancy to this space, making it a centrepiece for all the parties hosted by her. With a television screen and wall speakers opposite the sofas, one can imagine <strong>Nayanthara</strong> watching one of her favourite movies in this spacious room which is nothing less than a private movie screening.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Behind the heavy curtains drawn on the glass doors is the balcony overlooking the trees and plants. The green area surrounding Nayanthara\u2019s house spreads serenity and also helps the busy actress spend a little time in seclusion, away from the city\u2019s hustle and bustle.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The dining area of this celeb\u2019s home is just as magnificent as her style. Embellished with a breathtaking chandelier, the luminescence adds an edge. The kind of lighting in every part of the house is very well thought of and gives each room a different vibe. The dining area is connected to the main seating spot since the apartment spans over a large area. The interconnectedness of the dining and lobby makes the apartment seem large and extravagant.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All the bedrooms have a subtle d\u00e9cor with warm colours that are pleasing to the eye. From the exquisite curtains hanging in every room to the glass doors that open to fresh air, Nayanthara has not spared a penny to make this <strong>Hyderabad</strong> property an eye-turner. Ventilation is the most crucial factor in buying a house, and this celebrity&#8217;s home is the best example of that.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The spacious rooms have a separate seating area of their own. With recliner chairs and glass tables, the room itself has a world of its own. The walls of the bedrooms have a soothing white colour without the loudness of wallpapers. This can also be read as the actress&#8217;s choice of living, simple yet large.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The rooms oversee a scenic view that the actress can enjoy looking at through the huge glass doors. Or she can step out onto the balcony and spend a relaxing evening with nature.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>A Socially friendly Kitchen </strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Contrary to keeping the kitchen a separate hidden space from the rest of the rooms, <strong>Nayanthara\u2019s</strong> <strong>house</strong> has a huge open kitchen, overseeing the dining area. Adopting a contemporary concept of kitchen designs, the celebrity&#8217;s home has a modular look to it. The elements of modern design used to build this celeb&#8217;s kitchen are worth flaunting. A large tabletop with high stools is present so that cooking does not remain a lonely job but can be done overlooking the liveliness of the rest of the house. A sleek island unit in the middle of the kitchen is another concept adapted from the western interiors.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Epitome of Elegance</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The balcony houses a large hanging swing, which can frequently be spotted in <strong>Nayanthara\u2019s </strong>pictures. The balcony floor is covered with shining, new artificial grass that adds an aesthetic value to space, giving it a complete mini garden-like look.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The surrounding environment and atmosphere are perfect for the actress to practice yoga in her spare time and indulge in self-care. Moreover, the sunlight coming across from the glass doors would make a perfect morning for the actress to start her day afresh.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ornaments and furnishings in<strong> Nayanthara\u2019s house</strong> cover every table and flat surface present in the house. These ornaments vary from colourful potted plants to beautiful mini sculptures that add to the radiance of her home. The abundance of house-plants surely points towards the celeb&#8217;s love for nature and its beauty. There is no over-the-top bling to the house. All the decorations are subtle and elegant.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Not all Glitter</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is so much more to Nayanthara&#8217;s house than just fancy walls, glamour, and glitter. It has a sense of peace and calm. No doubt, she travels back to <strong>Hyderabad</strong> after her work to have a peaceful time at a place that she can call home. A home is a place that brings us solace. <strong>Nayanthara</strong> has built herself an apartment just like that. The homeliness of the plush furniture to the ornaments that represent a celebrity&#8217;s house is all a blend and balance of the perfect ingredients that one dreams of having in a home they wish to live in. The Queen of Kollywood sure knows how to live life Queen Size.</p>\n<p>FAQs</p>\n\n        <section class=\"sc_fs_faq sc_card\">\n            <div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Does Nayanthara have a house in Chennai?</h2>                <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNo, Nayanthara does not own a property in Chennai.

This is what makes it a home. It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s ours or someone else&#8217;s. But, when someone else is a Bollywood superstar (Kiara Advani), the house takes on a whole new meaning. It encapsulates the opulence and glamour that surrounds superstars.</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When we think of<strong> celebrity homes</strong>, we immediately think of the lavish, luxurious, spacious and well-decorated bungalows with an undeniable extravagance. Whether you&#8217;re seeking design ideas or just fantasising about your ultimate ideal home, some <strong>celeb homes</strong> are a great place to start. The efforts of designers and architects who work with them are immense, and they go above and beyond to make celebrities\u2019 abodes as extraordinary and beautiful as possible. Some of the best and the most popular Bollywood celebrities&#8217; homes are <em>Mannat</em>, the residence of Shahrukh Khan, <em>Jalsa</em> and <em>Pratiksha</em> of Amitabh Bachan, Salman Khan&#8217;s <em>Galaxy Heights</em> and the list goes on. Whenever tourists arrive in Mumbai, it is almost always the case that they visit these iconic homes and treat themselves to a peak from outside. It has almost become a tradition for people to look up to their success and admire their ultra-luxurious abodes. Today, let\u2019s take a virtual tour of the talented actress, Kiara Advani\u2019s brand new apartment nestled in the suburb Mahalaxmi area of Mumbai.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though she is fairly new in the fraternity, her achievement speaks volume about her talent and flair. Kiara Advani&#8217;s acting abilities and flexibility are taking her to great heights. It appears that acting has always run in her veins. She once shared in her cover interview with Vogue magazine that she was a full Hindi film buff in a school where it was &#8216;cool&#8217; to watch English films. Every time her friends contacted her, she would flip to an English channel. When no one was looking, she would listen to Govinda songs and deliver dialogues from Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She first appeared in front of the camera at the very tender age of eight years while shooting an advertisement for baby cream along with her mother. Well, most famous for her breakout role as Priti in Kabir Singh, Kiara Advani is on an unstoppable roll of delivering one blockbuster after another. She made her debut in Fugly and has even acted in 2 Telugu movies. After spreading her roots in the soils of Bollywood, she even left a mark on the OTT platform with the movie \u2018Guilty\u2019 and gave a critically acclaimed performance in \u2018Lust Stories,\u2019 both of which were directed by Karan Johar. Apart from having a family which has strong connections with Bollywood big shots, she was also fortunate to be mentored by Salman Khan.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This stunning actress has fourteen million followers on Instagram alone, and all of them are always trying to catch a glimpse of her not so &#8216;humble&#8217; abode.\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kiara Advani lives at the Planet Godrej building in Mahalaxmi, which is one of the area&#8217;s high-end developments. Planet Godrej&#8217;s apartments provide stunning 360-degree views of the Mahalaxmi Racecourse, the magnificent Haji Ali Mosque, and the much-loved Arabian Sea. The Mahalaxmi Race Course and the gorgeous Arabian Sea are seen from Advani&#8217;s property. Now, without any further ado, let&#8217;s quickly dive into this beautiful apartment. Have a Glance!</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Living room with all-white aesthetics</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Starting with the imperative part of the house, which is the living room. The living room gives out the first glimpse of the interiors of an abode, therefore it is indispensable to design this space magnificently, and it should be true to the owner&#8217;s personality. Kiara Advani&#8217;s plush living room is nothing less than perfection as it oozes her vibe and aesthetic sense. This area is lit up with natural sunlight with floor-to-wall ceiling windows, allowing fresh air to enter which helps in keeping the place buoyant. It provides a panoramic view of the Mahalaxmi race course and Mumbai\u2019s skyline. The whole theme of the room is white with a splash of gold. This is a great choice of colour because white creates an illusion of space and gives a bright aura to the room. The room is decorated with a huge white leather couch. She has added a white faux fur carpet to top off the whole decor, giving it a luxurious yet comfy feel. There is a huge potted plant next to the sofa, which adds a pop of colour. The couch is also laden with fancy plush pink and silver cushions. The wall directly above the sofa has a collection of mirrors which also helps in decluttering the space. Lastly, to bind all these elements together, the entire room is adorned with a textured gold wall. This whole decor is sure to give the guests an accurate impression of Kiara Advani\u2019s vibe and mirrors her unquestionable taste.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Balcony with a picturesque view</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The living room opens up to a large spacious balcony with a breathtaking view of the Mumbai skyline as well as the Arabian Sea. This alone sets this balcony class apart, but to take it a step further, Kiara did not shy away from decorating her entire balcony in white theme too. The outdoor furniture in the balcony is made up of cane material that is ideal for the outdoors. On one side of the balcony, the entire wall is textured golden, which undoubtedly adds beauty. In addition, a textured brown wall, colourful artwork in red and black colours, and gold vases provide contrast and warmth to this nook. It is quite clear from her Instagram posts that she loves to enjoy a piping hot cup of tea with her near and dear ones at the balcony spot. It is a dream for many. The balcony spot appears to be idyllic to watch Mumbai\u2019s picturesque skyline.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Instagram and Pinterest-worthy nook</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moving on to another most pictured spot in the apartment which is tucked away in a corner of her living room. Kiara loves to take pictures of all her mesmerizing outfits and red-carpet looks in front of this Instagram and Pinterest-worthy backdrop. This spot is adorned with an overall theme of mirrors and glass. The wall is covered with mosaic style small mirrors, a side glass table decorated with roses in a silver vase and big candles that serves as a backdrop for photos taken before the red carpet.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Dine like a star</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are many dazzling mirrors on the wall of the dining area. The modular spacious kitchen is striking and is well lit. It has white panelling all around which gives out a grandeur vibe. In addition, there are a lot of floral decorations to add colour and freshness.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Kiara and her love for flowers</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kiara is fond of flowers, and her love for them is quite evident from the interiors of her abode. Flowers do bring the energy of an entire place to a high. However, Kiara\u2019s face is as beautiful as any fresh flower, and the vitality in her eyes is as dazzling as any fresh flower lighting someone&#8217;s day. Her fondness for flowery designs may be seen in the outfits she wears. Kiara looks stunning in floral designs, whether it&#8217;s a floral blouse, a floral dress, or a floral lehenga. Statement items like flowers are used to add a hint of colours and liveliness to one\u2019s life. The flower-power keeps the place looking fresh and fragrant at all times. Kiara&#8217;s home appears to be brimming with the beauty of flowers, whether in large pots or dazzling vases. The whole layout of the apartment is smartly planned and well-executed. The formal sitting area is separated from the bedrooms by a long, well-lit corridor. This ensures the privacy of the hostess when she throws a party at her luxe abode. The corridor is laden with a lot of family and friends pictures to add a personal touch. There are also some beautiful artworks in this corridor.\u00a0 With creamy wall paint and wood panelling on the ceiling, her space has an earthy hue.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Living the life of her dream</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now let&#8217;s talk about the approximate cost of the apartment. After analyzing all the nooks and corners of the house in such detail, it&#8217;s natural for fans to be curious about the cost of these lavish apartments that are located in the Mahalaxmi area of Mumbai. Planet Godrej is a collection of five residential buildings sprawling on a 9-acre (3.6-hectare) property in Mahalaxmi, Mumbai. The towers are 181 metres (594 feet) tall with 51 stories and around 300 residential flats. After doing some digging, the approximate cost of the apartment seems to be at a whopping 14- 15 crore. However, it is crucial to keep in mind that these are just approximate figures. It could easily be more or less than that. Owing to her successful career in Bollywood, it doesn&#8217;t come across as a surprise to see this.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Wrapping Up</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kiara Advani made her Telugu debut in &#8220;Bharat Ennum Naan&#8221;, starring opposite popular Mahesh Babu. It does not surprise us that she charges almost two to three crores INR for her movies, and for a brand endorsement, she charges 20-25 lakhs INR. After her breakthrough role in Kabir Singh, she made almost 3 crores. Whether it is her blooming career or her beautiful house interiors, Kiara is a pro at both. After landing hits like &#8216;Good News&#8217; and &#8216;Laxmi&#8217; with co-stars such as Akshay Kumar and Kareena Kapoor Khan, it is to say that she is one the most promising upcoming faces of the industry.

            "content_text": "A house is more than simply a place to live; it encapsulates all of life&#8217;s joys and sorrows, and it echoes all of the past&#8217;s splendours. This is what makes it a home. It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s ours or someone else&#8217;s. But, when someone else is a Bollywood superstar (Kiara Advani), the house takes on a whole new meaning. It encapsulates the opulence and glamour that surrounds superstars.\nWhen we think of celebrity homes, we immediately think of the lavish, luxurious, spacious and well-decorated bungalows with an undeniable extravagance. Whether you&#8217;re seeking design ideas or just fantasising about your ultimate ideal home, some celeb homes are a great place to start. The efforts of designers and architects who work with them are immense, and they go above and beyond to make celebrities\u2019 abodes as extraordinary and beautiful as possible. Some of the best and the most popular Bollywood celebrities&#8217; homes are Mannat, the residence of Shahrukh Khan, Jalsa and Pratiksha of Amitabh Bachan, Salman Khan&#8217;s Galaxy Heights and the list goes on. Whenever tourists arrive in Mumbai, it is almost always the case that they visit these iconic homes and treat themselves to a peak from outside. It has almost become a tradition for people to look up to their success and admire their ultra-luxurious abodes. Today, let\u2019s take a virtual tour of the talented actress, Kiara Advani\u2019s brand new apartment nestled in the suburb Mahalaxmi area of Mumbai.\nEven though she is fairly new in the fraternity, her achievement speaks volume about her talent and flair. Kiara Advani&#8217;s acting abilities and flexibility are taking her to great heights. It appears that acting has always run in her veins. She once shared in her cover interview with Vogue magazine that she was a full Hindi film buff in a school where it was &#8216;cool&#8217; to watch English films. Every time her friends contacted her, she would flip to an English channel. When no one was looking, she would listen to Govinda songs and deliver dialogues from Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham.\nShe first appeared in front of the camera at the very tender age of eight years while shooting an advertisement for baby cream along with her mother. Well, most famous for her breakout role as Priti in Kabir Singh, Kiara Advani is on an unstoppable roll of delivering one blockbuster after another. She made her debut in Fugly and has even acted in 2 Telugu movies. After spreading her roots in the soils of Bollywood, she even left a mark on the OTT platform with the movie \u2018Guilty\u2019 and gave a critically acclaimed performance in \u2018Lust Stories,\u2019 both of which were directed by Karan Johar. Apart from having a family which has strong connections with Bollywood big shots, she was also fortunate to be mentored by Salman Khan.\nThis stunning actress has fourteen million followers on Instagram alone, and all of them are always trying to catch a glimpse of her not so &#8216;humble&#8217; abode.\u00a0\nKiara Advani lives at the Planet Godrej building in Mahalaxmi, which is one of the area&#8217;s high-end developments. Planet Godrej&#8217;s apartments provide stunning 360-degree views of the Mahalaxmi Racecourse, the magnificent Haji Ali Mosque, and the much-loved Arabian Sea. The Mahalaxmi Race Course and the gorgeous Arabian Sea are seen from Advani&#8217;s property. Now, without any further ado, let&#8217;s quickly dive into this beautiful apartment. Have a Glance!\nLiving room with all-white aesthetics\u00a0\nStarting with the imperative part of the house, which is the living room. The living room gives out the first glimpse of the interiors of an abode, therefore it is indispensable to design this space magnificently, and it should be true to the owner&#8217;s personality. Kiara Advani&#8217;s plush living room is nothing less than perfection as it oozes her vibe and aesthetic sense. This area is lit up with natural sunlight with floor-to-wall ceiling windows, allowing fresh air to enter which helps in keeping the place buoyant. It provides a panoramic view of the Mahalaxmi race course and Mumbai\u2019s skyline. The whole theme of the room is white with a splash of gold. This is a great choice of colour because white creates an illusion of space and gives a bright aura to the room. The room is decorated with a huge white leather couch. She has added a white faux fur carpet to top off the whole decor, giving it a luxurious yet comfy feel. There is a huge potted plant next to the sofa, which adds a pop of colour. The couch is also laden with fancy plush pink and silver cushions. The wall directly above the sofa has a collection of mirrors which also helps in decluttering the space. Lastly, to bind all these elements together, the entire room is adorned with a textured gold wall. This whole decor is sure to give the guests an accurate impression of Kiara Advani\u2019s vibe and mirrors her unquestionable taste.\u00a0\nBalcony with a picturesque view\nThe living room opens up to a large spacious balcony with a breathtaking view of the Mumbai skyline as well as the Arabian Sea. This alone sets this balcony class apart, but to take it a step further, Kiara did not shy away from decorating her entire balcony in white theme too. The outdoor furniture in the balcony is made up of cane material that is ideal for the outdoors. On one side of the balcony, the entire wall is textured golden, which undoubtedly adds beauty. In addition, a textured brown wall, colourful artwork in red and black colours, and gold vases provide contrast and warmth to this nook. It is quite clear from her Instagram posts that she loves to enjoy a piping hot cup of tea with her near and dear ones at the balcony spot. It is a dream for many. The balcony spot appears to be idyllic to watch Mumbai\u2019s picturesque skyline.\nInstagram and Pinterest-worthy nook\nMoving on to another most pictured spot in the apartment which is tucked away in a corner of her living room. Kiara loves to take pictures of all her mesmerizing outfits and red-carpet looks in front of this Instagram and Pinterest-worthy backdrop. This spot is adorned with an overall theme of mirrors and glass. The wall is covered with mosaic style small mirrors, a side glass table decorated with roses in a silver vase and big candles that serves as a backdrop for photos taken before the red carpet.\nDine like a star\u00a0\nThere are many dazzling mirrors on the wall of the dining area. The modular spacious kitchen is striking and is well lit. It has white panelling all around which gives out a grandeur vibe. In addition, there are a lot of floral decorations to add colour and freshness.\nKiara and her love for flowers\u00a0\nKiara is fond of flowers, and her love for them is quite evident from the interiors of her abode. Flowers do bring the energy of an entire place to a high. However, Kiara\u2019s face is as beautiful as any fresh flower, and the vitality in her eyes is as dazzling as any fresh flower lighting someone&#8217;s day. Her fondness for flowery designs may be seen in the outfits she wears. Kiara looks stunning in floral designs, whether it&#8217;s a floral blouse, a floral dress, or a floral lehenga. Statement items like flowers are used to add a hint of colours and liveliness to one\u2019s life. The flower-power keeps the place looking fresh and fragrant at all times. Kiara&#8217;s home appears to be brimming with the beauty of flowers, whether in large pots or dazzling vases. The whole layout of the apartment is smartly planned and well-executed. The formal sitting area is separated from the bedrooms by a long, well-lit corridor. This ensures the privacy of the hostess when she throws a party at her luxe abode. The corridor is laden with a lot of family and friends pictures to add a personal touch. There are also some beautiful artworks in this corridor.\u00a0 With creamy wall paint and wood panelling on the ceiling, her space has an earthy hue.\nLiving the life of her dream\nNow let&#8217;s talk about the approximate cost of the apartment. After analyzing all the nooks and corners of the house in such detail, it&#8217;s natural for fans to be curious about the cost of these lavish apartments that are located in the Mahalaxmi area of Mumbai. Planet Godrej is a collection of five residential buildings sprawling on a 9-acre (3.6-hectare) property in Mahalaxmi, Mumbai. The towers are 181 metres (594 feet) tall with 51 stories and around 300 residential flats. After doing some digging, the approximate cost of the apartment seems to be at a whopping 14- 15 crore. However, it is crucial to keep in mind that these are just approximate figures. It could easily be more or less than that. Owing to her successful career in Bollywood, it doesn&#8217;t come across as a surprise to see this.\nWrapping Up\u00a0\nKiara Advani made her Telugu debut in &#8220;Bharat Ennum Naan&#8221;, starring opposite popular Mahesh Babu. It does not surprise us that she charges almost two to three crores INR for her movies, and for a brand endorsement, she charges 20-25 lakhs INR. After her breakthrough role in Kabir Singh, she made almost 3 crores. Whether it is her blooming career or her beautiful house interiors, Kiara is a pro at both. After landing hits like &#8216;Good News&#8217; and &#8216;Laxmi&#8217; with co-stars such as Akshay Kumar and Kareena Kapoor Khan, it is to say that she is one the most promising upcoming faces of the industry. With her ever-growing fame and list of blockbuster hits, she is a force to be dealt with. It is exciting to see what all she is yet to offer to her fans. Her upcoming project is a sequel to the audience&#8217;s favourite &#8216;Bhool Bhulaiyaa&#8217;, keeping her fans on their toes. Apart from doing exceptionally well in the financial aspect, the actress has also won several awards which acknowledge her hard work and talent. Sandeep Marwah recently presented Kiara with a Life Membership of the International Film And Television Club of the Asian Academy of Film &amp; Television. She is also a recipient of zee cine awards for &#8220;Bharat Ane Nenu&#8221; and Asiavision Award in the emerging star of the year. All these great achievements of Kiara promises a prodigious career ahead.\nFAQs\n\n        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhat is Kiara Advani&#8217;s net worth?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tHer net worth as of 2021 is three million dollars.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhy did Kiara change her name?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe talented actress changed her first name to Kiara prior to the release of her first Bollywood film so that there is no confusion between her and the already well-known actress named Alia.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWho are Kiara Advani&#8217;s parents?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tHer parents are Jagdeep Advani and Genevieve Advani.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tHow much was the box office collection of her most popular film Kabir Singh?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tKabir Singh is the blockbuster film of her career as it made a total collection of 278 crore INR.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tHow is Kiara Advani related to Salman Khan?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tSalman Khan mentored Kiara Advani.

            "content_html": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We all know&nbsp;<strong>Chunky Pandey&nbsp;</strong>as a funny actor who is responsible for making us laugh hard through his exceptional acting skills.&nbsp;<strong>Chunky Pandey&nbsp;</strong>has made his mark in the film industry and has worked on many successful projects alongside big names. He lives in&nbsp;<strong>Mumbai&#8217;s Pali Hill&nbsp;</strong>area that is famously known for many&nbsp;<strong>celeb homes</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Chunky&nbsp;</strong>lives with his wife&nbsp;<strong>Bhavana Pandey&nbsp;</strong>and their two beautiful daughters&nbsp;<strong>Ananya Pandey&nbsp;</strong>and Rysa Pandey.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Chunky Pandey&#8217;s</strong>&nbsp;<strong>house&nbsp;</strong>is a perfect exemplar of a contemporary architectural design. He has given his bungalow a minimal but appealing approach. His star daughter&nbsp;<strong>Ananya Pandey&nbsp;</strong>has also shared some sneak peeks of their stylish abode from her well-known official Instagram handle. You will find some of her pics that she has taken inside their plush home when you scroll through her account. You can also Google&nbsp;<strong>Ananya Pandey house,&nbsp;</strong>and you&#8217;ll see some stunning photos of their abode.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though the&nbsp;<strong>Pali hill&nbsp;</strong>area is packed with countless notable&nbsp;<strong>celebrity homes</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Chunky Pandey</strong>&nbsp;<strong>house&nbsp;</strong>still manages to stand out due to an assortment of aspects, some of which we&#8217;re going to look at further in the blog.&nbsp;<strong>Chunky Pandey house</strong> is structured with many luxurious amenities like a home bar, garden and a vast lounge where the whole family gets together to spend some leisure time.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The house is built considering the wind directions to maximize the natural light and air ventilation throughout the structure. It also consists of an open to sky terrace, which the Pandey family often uses to rejuvenate themselves. The family additionally has pooches that live with them in one of the lush neighbourhoods of <strong>Mumbai</strong>. Ananya and Rysa are frequently seen in the living room and other areas with their pet canines. The living area is intended to look like a glasshouse, with mirrors adorning the walls. Chunky Pandey bought his opulent Pali Hill home in the 1990s when his career was at its pinnacle.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In front of the cottage are numerous varieties of plants. Ananya Pandey is frequently spotted doing yoga or simply painting at her favourite station around their home garden. She also relaxes on the terrace when she has a few minutes to spare. Now, let&#8217;s go over some interesting aspects of this property that make it worth the stare.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Key Facts about Chunky Pandey\u2019s Home D\u00e9cor</strong></h2>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Natural surrounding</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The bungalow is surrounded by natural greenery, which enhances the outward view of the house. Greenery surely helps in protecting the property from severe weathering effects. This idea also assists in safeguarding the health of the occupants as fresh air leads to healthy breathing and minimizes the chances of catching an infection.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Also, they&#8217;ve made a home garden inside, which contains diverse families of plants adding to the house&#8217;s charm. Plants are also said to be beneficial in reducing stress, which we can guess may be the reason for the Pandey family&#8217;s stress-free and attractive looks. You may have seen some Instagram pictures of <strong>Ananya Pandey&nbsp;</strong>in which she is seen roaming around their garden and clicking photos simultaneously. The modern architectural look in combination with the natural surrounding never fails to make the house look aesthetically alluring.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Correlative concept</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The house&#8217;s overall tone is very coordinated, and all parts of the building are interrelated in such a manner that adds to its beauty. All structural units like the living room, passages, bedrooms, etc., are laid out functionally to ease the accessibility aspect of the design.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And the furniture used in different areas is also pretty rich looking and cohesive. For example, if we talk about the living room, Panday&#8217;s living room is full of fascinating details, despite its statement-making carpeting. The room has black and white baroque couches, velvety ebony and gold coffee table, and numerous enormous vases bursting with flowers, all in keeping with the space&#8217;s colour scheme. But wait, there&#8217;s more! The party area contains furniture that offers unexpected splashes of colour to the room, perfectly blending distinct aesthetics.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A handful of shiny yellow pots and a vintage-style side table in a cheery shade of bright blue adds a character to space. The small elements are what tie the entire area together. The elaborate gold carvings on the table, for example, coordinate with the print on the black and white couches. The cohesive approach helps in building a sophisticated image of the house without making it look contrasting.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Functional illumination</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In a bustling city like Mumbai, it&#8217;s critical that one&#8217;s home feels like a hideaway with fresh air to breathe and sufficient sunlight- <strong>Ananya Pandey&#8217;s home</strong> covers all of these factors. The actress\u2019 apartment changes into a sun-drenched paradise throughout the day, thanks to the numerous floor-to-ceiling glass doors. Open spaces are created smartly to pass the light in every part of the house. The sunlight falling on the house during the daytime fetches the classy design of the home.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The doors also provide a view of the Panday&#8217;s outdoor area, which has rows and rows of plants, creating a relaxing atmosphere. Panday regularly visits the grassy spot to photograph her OOTDs before heading out to events, and she even celebrated Raksha Bandhan with her cousins there. The Panday&#8217;s also enjoy putting up their Christmas tree by the glass doors which helps in creating a pleasant festive cornucopia.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Good light and air ventilation help sustain the plant life surrounding the bungalow and their interior garden.

So appropriate design measures are needed to be taken while doing the home d\u00e9cor to enhance the residence&#8217;s internal feels. And as we are talking about <strong>Chunky Pandey\u2019s house</strong>, it just fulfils every requirement of a perfect interior design.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The interior of the house is done quite well. A look inside the Panday family&#8217;s&nbsp;<strong>Mumbai&nbsp;</strong>house reveals that it is everything but simple. While Ananya Panday&#8217;s living space is predominantly black and white, new photographs show her posing for a party in a cosy area with rich, dark green walls. How does one go about matching colours like that? The room&#8217;s furnishings are filled with black and white pieces (note the ivory couch bed and monochrome artwork), allowing the room&#8217;s dramatic walls to take centre stage. A red animal figurine on the bedside table is one of the only other sources of colour in the room. A touch of synergy is added to the home&#8217;s loo with black and white tile identical to that in the hall.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And coming to&nbsp;<strong>Ananya Pandey&#8217;s&nbsp;</strong>bedroom- gives us inspiration on how to be different from the typical yet sophisticated. The bedroom has been well decorated with oak flooring and crisp white walls. The entire bedroom has a basic feel to it. The living area features monochrome and patterned glossy flooring and vintage and nostalgic wooden interior d\u00e9cor motifs. The large glass windows are a major medium through which a lot of light enters, and the turquoise-hued table is embellished with gold. The rooms are decorated in sophisticated and elegant colours. Teal blue velvet chairs and couches are accented with olive green cushions. The spiral staircase leads to another peaceful spot in the house, designed to look like a loft.

The mirrored bar is encircled by velvety violet bar seats and has its pale blue cabinet stocked with bar necessities. Although the area&#8217;s colours are dark, the glass accents on the bar blend in magnificently with a spectrum of dazzling mirrors in the living room.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You may also have seen this party room in the stories posted by&nbsp;<strong>Ananya Pandey</strong>&nbsp;on Instagram<strong>, </strong>in which she is seen having fun with her friends. This area is perfect for times like lockdown when clubs and pubs in the city are shut, and there&#8217;s nowhere to go.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Ending remarks</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Chunky Pandey&nbsp;</strong>as an actor, has seen many ups and downs, and there was a time in his career when he had to introduce himself in the Bangladeshi film industry because of no projects in Bollywood.

            "content_text": "We all know&nbsp;Chunky Pandey&nbsp;as a funny actor who is responsible for making us laugh hard through his exceptional acting skills.&nbsp;Chunky Pandey&nbsp;has made his mark in the film industry and has worked on many successful projects alongside big names. He lives in&nbsp;Mumbai&#8217;s Pali Hill&nbsp;area that is famously known for many&nbsp;celeb homes.&nbsp;Chunky&nbsp;lives with his wife&nbsp;Bhavana Pandey&nbsp;and their two beautiful daughters&nbsp;Ananya Pandey&nbsp;and Rysa Pandey.&nbsp;\nChunky Pandey&#8217;s&nbsp;house&nbsp;is a perfect exemplar of a contemporary architectural design. He has given his bungalow a minimal but appealing approach. His star daughter&nbsp;Ananya Pandey&nbsp;has also shared some sneak peeks of their stylish abode from her well-known official Instagram handle. You will find some of her pics that she has taken inside their plush home when you scroll through her account. You can also Google&nbsp;Ananya Pandey house,&nbsp;and you&#8217;ll see some stunning photos of their abode.&nbsp;\nEven though the&nbsp;Pali hill&nbsp;area is packed with countless notable&nbsp;celebrity homes,&nbsp;Chunky Pandey&nbsp;house&nbsp;still manages to stand out due to an assortment of aspects, some of which we&#8217;re going to look at further in the blog.&nbsp;Chunky Pandey house is structured with many luxurious amenities like a home bar, garden and a vast lounge where the whole family gets together to spend some leisure time.\nThe house is built considering the wind directions to maximize the natural light and air ventilation throughout the structure. It also consists of an open to sky terrace, which the Pandey family often uses to rejuvenate themselves. The family additionally has pooches that live with them in one of the lush neighbourhoods of Mumbai. Ananya and Rysa are frequently seen in the living room and other areas with their pet canines. The living area is intended to look like a glasshouse, with mirrors adorning the walls. Chunky Pandey bought his opulent Pali Hill home in the 1990s when his career was at its pinnacle.\nIn front of the cottage are numerous varieties of plants. Ananya Pandey is frequently spotted doing yoga or simply painting at her favourite station around their home garden. She also relaxes on the terrace when she has a few minutes to spare. Now, let&#8217;s go over some interesting aspects of this property that make it worth the stare.\nKey Facts about Chunky Pandey\u2019s Home D\u00e9cor\nNatural surrounding\nThe bungalow is surrounded by natural greenery, which enhances the outward view of the house. Greenery surely helps in protecting the property from severe weathering effects. This idea also assists in safeguarding the health of the occupants as fresh air leads to healthy breathing and minimizes the chances of catching an infection.\nAlso, they&#8217;ve made a home garden inside, which contains diverse families of plants adding to the house&#8217;s charm. Plants are also said to be beneficial in reducing stress, which we can guess may be the reason for the Pandey family&#8217;s stress-free and attractive looks.
