<p class="has-text-align-justify">Celebrity homes have always been in the media, doing rounds on the Internet and being talked about in full grace. Over the years, the trend depicts actors preferring Porsche and spacious residences for themselves. The fact that home is the place they spend most of the time apart from studios makes it worthwhile. Most Indian actors have proven to be spendthrifts when it comes to planning their abode. Similarly, the celeb home we are going to talk about here is the one owned by the famous south-Indian actor Allu Arjun.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Allu Arjun&#8217;s house in Hyderabad is an expansive one and includes unmissable amenities. Well, this blog intends to take our readers on a journey to witness each aspect of the very famous celebrity home. From child-friendly corners to party corners, the house has it all. It is expansive in the sense that hardly is there any area where one would feel closely packed.</p>



<h2 id="h-allu-arjun-s-journey">Allu Arjun’s Journey</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The south-Indian industry takes pride in beholding such great talents of all times. Allu Arjun has left no stone unturned in winning the hearts of fans. In the Telugu film industry, some of his famous hits include Naa Peru Surya, Ala Vaikunta Puram, and Naa Illu India. Initially, the actor resided with his family in a bungalow located in the Jubilee Hills region of Hyderabad. However, post his brother&#8217;s marriage, he shifted to the city&#8217;s outskirts, building his own house named &#8216;Blessing.&#8217;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In his new modernized palace, the actor lives with his wife, Allu Sneha Reddy, an actor belonging to the same industry. The couple resides in the house with three significantly distinctive members. They are none other than their children Arha and Ayaan, also, not to miss out, Kazoku, their beloved pet dog. The residence is big enough to accommodate all its members and the luxuries they need. Also, the backyard is another part of the house that you can&#8217;t miss out on.</p>



<h2 id="h-key-features-of-allu-arjun-s-home">Key Features of Allu Arjun’s Home</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="800" src="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Key-Features-of-Allu-Arjuns-Home.jpg" alt="Key Features of Allu Arjun’s Home" class="wp-image-31275" srcset="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Key-Features-of-Allu-Arjuns-Home.jpg 640w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Key-Features-of-Allu-Arjuns-Home-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption>Source: Instagram</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The distinctive part about the celebrity home is the structure that makes it stand out. It is a box-shaped house with all amenities inside it. Besides, there is a backyard that has been specially gifted to the junior Allu by his grandfather. The structuring and designing of the house were undertaken by a firm named Aamir &amp; Hameeda Associates, with Aamir Sharma being the designer himself. The circumscribing plot that the house was built on is nothing less than two acres in its measurement. As claimed by the designer, the actor wanted his house to be a &#8220;comfortable holiday home.&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Keeping his specific requirements in mind, the house was designed just the right way. Today, architecture enthusiasts drool over the structuring and detailing of the Allu Arjun house. Taking note of the modern interiors alongside convenience, the major areas of the house have been kept connected to one another for easy access. Thus, one would find the kitchen, living room, dining area, and bar right close to one another.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The overall design of the house is very minimalistic yet offers a classic modern-day look and feel. The corridor-like structure built right from the entrance leads to the living spaces. Very interestingly, an artificial grass-like pattern has been used by the designer in a wall that connects to the garden lying in the backyard of the house. Also, the swimming area holds a canopy owing to which the beautiful seating area is mostly under ignorance. Spread over 8000 Sq. Ft, the celebrity home in Hyderabad stands as a true elegance to witness.</p>



<h2 id="h-interesting-insights-about-allu-arjun-s-abode">Interesting Insights About Allu Arjun’s Abode</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="783" src="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Interesting-Insights-About-Allu-Arjuns-Abode.jpg" alt="Interesting Insights About Allu Arjun’s Abode" class="wp-image-31277" srcset="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Interesting-Insights-About-Allu-Arjuns-Abode.jpg 640w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Interesting-Insights-About-Allu-Arjuns-Abode-245x300.jpg 245w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption>Source: Instagram</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">It would be surprising to hear that the celeb home is constructed out of low-maintenance materials. For example, epoxy cement has been used for the in-house flooring, linking kitchen, bar counters, and several shelves in the seating areas. However, the dining area is another point of attraction in the house. It is a cemented base topped with glass, backed by white ply benches. Moreover, the benches have been made moveable to fit into the outdoor vibe.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Another specific attractive area is the bar counter. The area is coupled with bar tools in white color. On the hind side of the bar, there lies a very elegant piece of artefact which is not one. It holds a metal plank with nails on it, which functions as a bottle holder. To suit the whole minimalistic vibe of the house, its specific corners have been groomed with quirky accessories to add to the vibe and, in turn, make it look elegant.</p>

<h2 id="h-kid-s-corner-in-arjun-s-abode">Kid’s corner in Arjun’s Abode</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The house with two kids deserves the right attention for the two. There need to be some factors present for the kids to call it home.

The actor&#8217;s love for his kids as a father is truly depicted in his public posts.<br></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">nother item in the room is a floating wall-like shelving structure that is meant for the kid to portray his collection so far. Besides, there lies a specific television room in the house where the kids are seen spending some relaxation time. The pool, the greenery, and the plant life all around the house are other interesting nooks for the kids. The family pictures on different parts of the house shared on various social media platforms depict the bonding that the family shares with the house.</p>



<h2 id="h-other-prized-possessions-owned-by-allu-arjun">Other prized possessions owned by Allu Arjun</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The south-Indian actor has spent his hard-earned money to get himself the best of all. Furthermore, several other remarkable possessions are of high value for the actor. Though he has been spotted adorning himself in luxurious and expensive clothing, there is quite some other extra spending that the actor keeps a knack for.

<h3 id="h-a-vanity-van">A vanity van</h3>

The van comprises certain symbolic features such as a giant mirror, leather seats, and many more. There is no doubt that the actor prefers style and elegance for all things equally.</p>



<h3 id="h-jaguar-xj-l">Jaguar XJ L</h3>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The actor’s possession of a customized vanity van brings forth his interest in vehicles. Similarly, he has invested ₹1.2 crores in a Jaguar XJ L.

<h2 id="h-range-rover-vogue">Range rover vogue</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The actor&#8217;s love for cars seems never-ending. He has been a spendthrift in this regard. One of his Instagram posts with the car and the perfect caption portrays how much of a car lover he is. It cost him about ₹1.88 crores to ₹ 4.03 crores approx, and hence it is definitely on the list of his prized possessions.</p>



<h2 id="h-volvo-xc90-t8-excellence">Volvo XC90 T8 Excellence</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">It cost him about ₹1.30-1.35 crore to get this beast. But, his love towards his beasts keeps adding to his collection. Nevertheless, his collection is something that most enthusiasts might be drooling over.</p>



<h2 id="h-wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">A house is often regarded as something more than just a mere dwelling place.

No wonder why &#8216;Blessing&#8217; the house is truly a blessing in itself for the whole Allu family.</p>

We have all heard of Shah Rukh Khan&#8217;s &#8220;Mannat,&#8221; Amitabh Bachchan&#8217;s &#8220;Jalsa,&#8221; and John Abraham&#8217;s &#8220;Villa In The Sky.&#8221; Rohit Shetty is the most recent celebrity to join the premium house party in Mumbai.</p>



<p>While most celebrities buy magnificent homes or villas after becoming wealthy, famous Bollywood director-producer Rohit Shetty has gone a notch up and purchased a whole building. The director has acquired a 10-story property in Juhu, one of Mumbai&#8217;s most affluent neighborhoods. Juhu is a renowned neighborhood where several well-known celebrities have luxury houses. You may easily come across spectacular bungalows and extravagant flats with beautiful gardens and luxurious facilities that will astound anybody who passes by. Renowned Bollywood filmmaker, Rohit Shetty’s house is one such luxurious example. Shetty’s skyscraper was originally called Ishaan after his son, but now has a “Shetty Tower” sign on the entrance.</p>

<p>According to sources, Rohit Shetty and his family have moved into the 10-story tower&#8217;s top two levels. Rohit Shetty&#8217;s Mumbai house, named &#8220;Shetty Tower,&#8221; is reported to be Rohit Shetty&#8217;s dream house. The filmmaker of &#8220;Golmaal&#8221; had planned to develop a home in one of Mumbai&#8217;s finest areas for eleven years, and his hard work and commitment had finally paid off.</p>



<p>Every Bollywood fan knows Rohit Shetty&#8217;s passion for automobiles, and we have seen his blockbuster films feature a diverse range of vehicles. As a result, the filmmaker has decided to devote the first four levels of his 10-story celebrity mansion to his high-end vehicle collection. Lamborghini Urus, Maserati GT Sport, Ford Mustang GT (2016), Range Rover, and BMW 7-Series (earlier version) are among his premium vehicles. You should also be aware that Rohit Shetty enjoys customizing his automobiles. This is why most vehicles, like the Ford Mustang GT and Range Rover, have extra features and distinctive colours. Each of these vehicles would cost between 1.2 and 2 crores.</p>

<p>Rohit Shetty&#8217;s Mumbai residence was completed last year, and it has a large lawn as well as a high-end security cabin.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-brief-overview-of-shetty-tower-s-architecture"><strong>A Brief Overview of Shetty Tower’s Architecture</strong></h2>



<p>Located on Hasya Kalakar Mehmood Chowk in Juhu, Shetty Tower stands tall over other structures and can easily be distinguished. The residence of Rohit Shetty is a wonderful example of contemporary architecture. He has designed his house in a simple yet appealing manner. The Shetty Tower is a structure that prioritizes utility and a clean aesthetic over ornamentation. The design style differs from that of more ornately adorned residences. The tower is strewn with sprawling verandahs on each floor and the same are embellished with plants. In a hectic metropolis like Mumbai, it is important that one&#8217;s house feels like a getaway, with adequate natural light and fresh air to breathe. Rohit Shetty&#8217;s abode meets all of these requirements. Owing to the multiple floor-to-ceiling glass doors installed on the verandahs, the filmmaker&#8217;s residence transforms into a sun-drenched bliss throughout the day. The house&#8217;s elegant appearance is enhanced by the sunshine pouring on it during the daytime.</p>



<p>The Shetty Tower also has a sprawling home garden inside, which contains diverse families of plants adding to the house&#8217;s appeal. Plants are also known to help with stress reduction, which might explain the reason for the ever so joyous look on Shetty&#8217;s face. Apart from the interiors, the exteriors are equally adorned with lush greenery, making the top half of the structure peep over the various trees. The house&#8217;s visually pleasing appearance is always enhanced by the modern architectural aspect combined with the natural surroundings. The general tone of the house is very well-coordinated, and all of the building&#8217;s components are interconnected in a way that adds to its charm.</p>



<p>Aside from the aforementioned amenities, the Shetty Tower also possesses the highest level of security. Emergency buzzers, intercoms, escape chute and top-of-the-line security installations guarantee the Shetty family a hassle-free life.</p>

<p>Rohit Shetty was born in Mumbai, India, on March 14, 1973. He is presently one of India&#8217;s highest-paid directors and a permanent member of the highest-grossing films club. Shetty began his career as an assistant director to Kuku Kohli on Ajay Devgn&#8217;s debut film, Phool Aur Kaante, when he was 17 years old. He had some prior knowledge about the Hindi film industry, thanks to his parents, Ratna Shetty and M.B Shetty, who both were actors and have worked in Bollywood. Across many media appearances, the director has recounted living in an apartment in Dahisar, earning ₹35 per day, going through an economic meltdown, and taking the Mumbai local to get to work on time. Since then, he has directed blockbusters like Golmaal and Singham, as well as commercial hits like Chennai Express and Bol Bachchan.</p>



<p>It is difficult to say how much Shetty&#8217;s property is worth, but it will almost certainly be a lot of money, given that property prices in this area range from Rs 50,000 to Rs 80,000 per Sq. Ft. According to sources, his house is believed to be worth approximately ₹6 crores. Shetty also has a number of real-estate holdings around the country.</p>

In the last several years, Rohit Shetty&#8217;s net worth has increased by 58%. Mr Shetty&#8217;s net worth is made up of movie earnings, personal investments, and his production company, “Rohit Shetty Production House Pvt. Ltd.” one of the biggest production companies in Bollywood. Apart from films, television has also contributed significantly to Rohit Shetty&#8217;s net worth. On television, the filmmaker has appeared as a judge/host on series such as Comedy Circus and Khatron Ke Khiladi. According to rumours, Shetty was paid 30 lakhs to host Khatron Ke Khiladi in 2019 and would be paid 1 crore to feature in the show this year.</p>

<h2 id="h-ending-remarks"><strong>Ending Remarks</strong></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <em>God of Cricket</em>, Sachin Tendulkar, needs no introduction. There has been immense interest in knowing about <strong>Sachin Tendulkar house</strong>s in Mumbai and overall <strong>Sachin Tendulkar property</strong> in India. <strong>Sachin’s house </strong>was earlier in a plush apartment complex. However, the new <strong>Sachin Tendulkar home</strong>s in Mumbai are a bungalow and luxurious apartment respectively. One <strong>Sachin house </strong>is at Perry Cross Road at Bandra West. This <strong>Sachin Tendulkar house in Mumbai </strong>and the family’s primary residence, covers a massive 6,000 square feet. The <strong>Sachin Tendulkar house price </strong>was reportedly around Rs. 39 crore which the superstar paid for buying the plot in the year 2007. He has spent another 40-45 crores on renovations and transforming the dilapidated villa that once sat on this plot, into the imposing 5-storied villa that we see today.</p>
<p>Another <strong>Sachin house in Mumbai </strong>is the lavish property that he purchased for Anjali Tendulkar, his wife, in Mumbai. This <strong>Sachin Tendulkar house address</strong> is at Rustomjee Seasons in the BKC (Bandra-Kurla Complex) and the <strong>Tendulkar house</strong> reportedly cost around Rs. 7.5 crore. This is a spacious 1600 square feet apartment with luxurious amenities and facilities. Interestingly, sometime earlier, an Anjali <strong>Tendulkar house</strong> in the ultra-prime Malabar Hill, Mumbai, was sold to a businessman for a whopping sum of Rs. 145 crore. <em>Mehta House</em>, this property, belonged to her parents.</p>
<h3><strong>Sachin Tendulkar house facts </strong></h3>
<p>The current <strong>Sachin Tendulkar home in Mumbai </strong>was reconstructed after he purchased the plot in the year 2007 at Perry Cross Road. He shifted into this property with his family in the year 2011. The overall <strong>Sachin home </strong>cost thus stands at upwards of Rs. 80 crore. The pre-independence property housed a classic Paris villa and it is now a sprawling villa with five floors and 1 ½ floors remain underground as per BMC guidelines pertaining to the heights of buildings. The bungalow lies along one of Mumbai’s most prime locations with a view of the Arabian Sea as well.</p>
<p>The area is home to numerous celebrities and movie stars alike. Sachin Tendulkar has reportedly taken out an insurance policy of Rs. 100 crore for this property, inclusive of Rs. 75 crore in fire insurance and added coverage of Rs. 25 crore for its interiors. This policy also offers coverage for damages owing to acts of God like earthquakes, terrorism and other activities like bomb blasts, burglaries and so on. Items like the compound walls, cost of the land of the bungalow, security installations, water reservoir and electrical equipment are also covered under this insurance plan. The 3-storied mansion comes with two basements and they can readily house 40-50 cars together. There is a secondary kitchen on the upper basement along with the servant quarters and a master surveillance zone for security requirements.</p>
<p>There is a high-walled fence for this property which restricts outside views and the ground floor has a temple where the star cricketer’s mother spends a lot of her time. The kitchen is sleek with a contemporary cook-top and granite countertop while the cricketer has his favorite corner in the bungalow where he records a majority of his videos on Instagram. He relaxes in the garden area as well which has a small sitting area or cabana where he records messages. Numerous lovely paintings adorn the home and the huge living room comes with brown and white hues. The living room has premium couches with vibrant cushions and the ceiling is close to 20 feet! The bungalow also comes with a glass bridge linking the lobby of two separate structures in reality. One side has the master bedroom and the other side has the rooms of the children. The bungalow has a big garden with rows and rows of shrubs, palm trees, tropical plants, a small pond and succulents.</p>
<h3><strong>Sachin Tendulkar’s Mumbai apartment- Key Facts</strong></h3>
<p>Sachin Tendulkar purchased a lavish apartment in Rustomjee Seasons, BKC, for his wife Anjali Tendulkar sometime earlier. This home has been designed by the Singapore-based interior design firm, Etho Space. The apartment has been designed painstakingly with environment-friendly features as well and the best construction technologies. The interiors sport an earthy look and feel which is stylish while the kitchen flaunts a minimalistic design theme with modern amenities.</p>
<p>The living room is cozy and aesthetically appealing, particularly for its artistically designed and contemporary interiors. There are plush furnishings adorning the living room which lend a whole new elegance to the look. The study is themed in black with a classy touch to it and a world map positioned upon a wall in tandem with accompanying glass doors all around. This is a great meeting space for the couple. The apartment also comes with its own terrace that may be viewed from all the study and living room alike.</p>

<p>The box office superstar, Ajay Devgn is one of the most bankable actors of Bollywood today. After all, in 2019 he was featured in Forbes India’s Celebrity 100 list and back then he had bagged the 12th spot with annual earnings of ₹94 crore. His massive net worth mirrors his ultra-rich lifestyle that has been nothing but super luxurious with plush abodes, pricey cars and other high-end possessions.</p>
<p>His most recent purchase is an  opulent  bungalow in Juhu worth a whopping ₹60 crore, a hefty price, indeed. The  exquisite bungalow sprawls across 590 Sq. Yds. and it is in the vicinity of his current residence Shakti.</p>

<p>Well, it seems like Juhu is the new vibrant hotspot and preferred prime locality for Bollywood celebrities as it already hosts a dozen of other celebrities like Alia Bhatt, Amitabh Bachchan, Hrithik Roshan, etc. However, Ajay’s new purchase is already making fans curious as the renovation work of the bungalow has begun.</p>
<p>Some of the  other high-end priced possessions owned by Ajay Devgn include &#8211; a private jet, ₹54 crore luxurious bungalow in London, ₹6.5 crore Rolls Royce Cullinan, ₹1.5 crore Maserati car and many more.</p>

<p>Megastar Amitabh Bachchan has once again made  headlines and this time for splurging on a brand new duplex apartment worth ₹31 Crore. Located in the heart of Mumbai, Amitabh Bachchan has bought a sprawling duplex apartment that spreads over an area of 5,704 Sq. Ft. in Andheri, the western suburbs of Mumbai.</p>
<p>According to reports, he bought the property in December 2020 by paying a stamp duty of ₹62 lakh, which is 2 percent of ₹31 crore but got it registered in April 2021. Due to the stamp duty cut waiver offered by the Maharashtra state government last year, a lot of big-ticket real estate deals had taken place between September 2020 and March 2021.</p>
<blockquote><p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-30596" src="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-27-1280x720-1-300x169.png" alt="Bollywood Celebrity: Amitabh Bachchan Home" width="421" height="237" srcset="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-27-1280x720-1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-27-1280x720-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-27-1280x720-1-768x432.png 768w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-27-1280x720-1.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px" /></p></blockquote>
<p>Big B’s grandeur apartment is situated on the 27th and 28th floor of the building and the icing on the cake is that it comes with six mechanised parking slots. Apart from the new Andheri apartment, Big B is the proud owner of many multi-crore properties like Jalsa, Janak, Prateeksha, Vatsa.</p>
<p>According to several reports, filmmaker Anand L Rai and Bollywood celebrity Sunny Leone have also bought a luxe duplex apartment in the same complex.

<p>Arjun Kapoor has recently completed ten years in the film industry. On the work front, he is grabbing attention and garnering praises for his last performance in the film Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar. Basking in the success of his last film, Arjun Kapoor has gifted himself a swanky sea-facing 4 BHK  apartment near his ladylove Malika Arora’s abode in one of Mumbai’s posh localities.</p>
<p>Arjun Kapoor’s new villa offers amenities that justify the price of his newly purchased apartment such as four personalized sea-facing capsule elevators that will drop you right to your villa, private pool, gym, library, yoga deck, open café, play area, business lounge, mini-golf course, spa and a pet corner.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><figure id="attachment_30599" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-30599" style="width: 535px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-30599" src="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/download.jpg" alt="Bollywood celebrities' sea-facing apartment" width="535" height="300" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-30599" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Source: india.com</strong></em></figcaption></figure></p></blockquote>
<p>The picturesque and breathtaking view of Mumbai’s skyline and Bandra-Worli sea link is seen from Arjun’s extravagant 4 BHK apartment. The high-rise building has 81 sky villas and each villa consists of  massive 4 bedrooms which come with a private pool on the outdoor deck, spacious closet space and balcony. Isn’t this a dream home?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in December 2020, his little step-sister Janhvi Kapoor had bought an expensive luxurious apartment in Juhu. Janhvi’s luxurious apartment is worth ₹39 crores which sprawls across three floors and is located in one of the most lavish suburban areas of the city.</p>

It was never a doubt to anyone if&nbsp;<strong>Nana Patekar</strong>&nbsp;can play a role or not in a particular film. Since then, having debuted in the movie &#8220;Gaman &#8221; in 1979,&nbsp;<strong>Nana Patekar</strong>&nbsp;has played several characters in the Indian Film Industry<strong>.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><strong><span lang="EN-IN" style="color: #0e101a;">Nana Patekar</span></strong><span lang="EN-IN" style="color: #0e101a;">&nbsp;has been highly praised for his role in the film &#8220;Salaam Bombay&#8221; in 1988, and he won a National award for the best supporting role in the movie &#8220;Parinda&#8221; in 1989. N<strong>ana Patekar&nbsp;</strong>is not only an actor, but he is also a writer, a screenwriter, a filmmaker, and a philanthropist. While perfecting his role in Prahaar,&nbsp;<strong>Nana Patekar</strong>&nbsp;had gone through rigorous army training for three years, for which he was given the honorary title of &#8220;Captain&#8221; in the 1990s. He has worked in many great films such as Krantiveer, Ab Tak Chhapan, Taxi No 9 2 11, Yeshwant, etc., and has successfully entranced the audience in every walk of his career. The actor mainly worked in Hindi and Marathi films.&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-IN" style="color: #0e101a;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p></p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">Nana Patekar,a true philanthropist-&nbsp;</h2>
<p></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-IN" style="color: #0e101a;">Even though&nbsp;<strong>Nana Patekar</strong>&nbsp;is an amazing actor and a great filmmaker, he never made a show of his generosity and philanthropy, keeping his personal life and kind deeds to himself.&nbsp;<strong>Nana Patekar</strong>&nbsp;had stepped himself up for the farmers of Maharashtra when they were suffering in unimaginable ways. During the Vidharba drought in 2015<strong>, Nana Patekar</strong>&nbsp;had hugely supported the farmers in Maharashtra. He has generously donated to the families of farmers who had committed suicide and gave a cheque of INR 15,000 to almost 62 families in Maharashtra<strong>. Nana Patekar</strong>&nbsp;has personally visited 112 families in Latur during the period of drought to inspect their conditions and extended a helping hand to them.&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-IN" style="color: #0e101a;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p></p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><strong><span lang="EN-IN" style="color: #0e101a;">The Naam Foundation-</span></strong><span lang="EN-IN" style="color: #0e101a;">&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><strong><span lang="EN-IN" style="color: #0e101a;">Nana Patekar</span></strong><span lang="EN-IN" style="color: #0e101a;">, along with Makarand Anaspune, created the Naam Foundation in September 2015. It was founded considering the negligence towards the devastating drought situations in Maharashtra and the increase in the number of farmer suicides due to the drought. The constant water crisis in those areas led to the rapid degeneration of the villages in Maharashtra. The villagers and the farmers were not getting safe drinking water, let alone the water to cultivate.</span><span style="color: #0e101a; font-size: inherit;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-IN" style="color: #0e101a;">And, the climatic conditions of those regions were also not in favour of the farmers. Being a true philanthropist and humanitarian,&nbsp;<strong>Nana Patekar</strong>&nbsp;founded the Naam Foundation as a response to the problems of the farmers. The Naam Foundation seeks to educate the farmers, reviving the canals and abandoned water projects in that area, and restoring the groundwater. The major aim of the Naam Foundation is to fill up the dried lakes and rivers and provide safe and clean drinking water to the people of Maharashtra. As per his efforts, many of the above prospects have successfully been completed.</span><span lang="EN-IN" style="color: #0e101a;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-IN" style="color: #0e101a;">The Naam Foundation has already managed to collect INR 22 lakhs for the farmers’ welfare from many people<strong>. Nana Patekar</strong> himself has donated almost 90% of his earnings to charity till now. The Naam Foundation can connect the people to the areas as far as Nagpur, Latur, Hingoli, Parbhani, Nanded, Aurangabad, etc. And has evolved from a movement to an organization facilitating developments in the villages of Maharashtra.</span><span lang="EN-IN" style="color: #0e101a;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p></p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><strong><span lang="EN-IN" style="color: #0e101a;">The houses in which Nana Patekar lives and the lifestyle he leads-</span></strong><span lang="EN-IN" style="color: #0e101a;">&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><strong><span lang="EN-IN" style="color: #0e101a;">Nana Patekar&nbsp;</span></strong><span lang="EN-IN" style="color: #0e101a;">was born and brought up in&nbsp;<strong>Murud,</strong>&nbsp;Maharashtra and his father passed away at the age of 28 years. Even though he reportedly has assets of INR 40 crores, he lives a very simple life. The lifestyle he leads is a reflection of his way of living. Currently,&nbsp;<strong>Nana Patekar’s house</strong>&nbsp;is a 1BHK apartment in&nbsp;<strong>Andheri, Mumbai&nbsp;</strong>which he formerly used to share with his mother. Most&nbsp;<strong>celebs</strong>&nbsp;prefer to have costly and comfortable houses so they can flex about it. This contradicts the way Nana<strong>&nbsp;Patekar</strong>&nbsp;leads his lifestyle in his 1BHK apartment in&nbsp;<strong>Andheri, Mumbai</strong>. It explains how he leads his lifestyle because his simple home is surely a down-to-earth attribute.&nbsp;<strong>Nana Patekar</strong>&#8216;s achievements in the entirety of his career and still counting are like a golden feather in his cap as he is a great philanthropist and has great empathy towards the people in trouble.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-IN" style="color: #0e101a;">Even if he is a great artist compared to none, he leads a straightforward life and dresses quite plainly.</span><span lang="EN-IN" style="color: #0e101a;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-IN" style="color: #0e101a;">A few years ago, <strong>Nana Patekar</strong>&nbsp;had purchased a&nbsp;<strong>farmhouse</strong>&nbsp;in Khadakwasla, which is near&nbsp;<strong>Pune.</strong>&nbsp;That place is very peaceful and calm, away from the chaos of the city. One can go there and spend a relaxing vacation in that farmhouse.&nbsp;<strong>Nana Patekar&nbsp;</strong>spends most of his time in that&nbsp;<strong>farmhouse</strong>&nbsp;in Khadakwasla, as it is situated in a peaceful area. The&nbsp;<strong>farmhouse&nbsp;</strong>has an area of 27 acres and is a beautiful place. Complimenting his simple personality, he also likes to live in a calming and peaceful place. Speaking of&nbsp;<strong>Nana Patekar’s farmhouse</strong>, it has seven rooms and a large hall. Although it is a large house, the interior of the&nbsp;<strong>farmhouse</strong>&nbsp;is very subtle and nothing fancy&nbsp;<strong>Nana Patekar</strong>&nbsp;has never been materialistic in his whole life and has great concern for the people.&nbsp;<strong>Nana Patekar</strong>&nbsp;is such a man who can claim that he has donated almost 90% of his earnings to the charity.</span><span lang="EN-IN" style="color: #0e101a;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-IN" style="color: #0e101a;">Reports claim that&nbsp;<strong>Nana Patekar</strong>&nbsp;cultivates paddy and wheat in his&nbsp;<strong>farmhouse at Pune</strong>&nbsp;and sells the crop collected throughout the state. Afterward, he would distribute all the money among the workers in the fields at the&nbsp;<strong>farmhouse</strong>. This has been an employment source to many people. The generosity he holds is incomparable and cannot be measured through materialistic means.&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-IN" style="color: #0e101a;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-IN" style="color: #0e101a;">Earlier, it was confirmed that&nbsp;<strong>Nana Patekar</strong>&nbsp;had bought a house in&nbsp;<strong>Murud</strong>. The house is a lovely bungalow situated on Law College Road in&nbsp;<strong>Pune.</strong>&nbsp;It was recognized to be the same bungalow where he used to sneak into its backyard and steal Indian plums and white jam in his childhood.&nbsp;<strong>Nana Patekar</strong>&nbsp;seems to commemorate his past and childhood memories through these activities<strong>. Nana Patekar</strong>&nbsp;was known to have a difficult childhood as his father died at 28 years. His father used to be posted in&nbsp;<strong>Mumbai</strong>, but&nbsp;<strong>Nana Patekar</strong>&nbsp;and his siblings were living in&nbsp;<strong>Murud</strong>&nbsp;along with their mother. But, he has kept his childhood happy moments through these possessions.</span><span lang="EN-IN" style="color: #0e101a;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><strong><span lang="EN-IN" style="color: #0e101a;">Nana Patekar</span></strong><span lang="EN-IN" style="color: #0e101a;">&nbsp;has become a brand name of simplicity and compassion. Despite being a versatile actor, a great filmmaker, a screenwriter, he has never forgotten his roots and his people. He is a great humanitarian who has never been indulged in any form of social biases. His Naam Foundation has done a great job in facilitating development and welfare in various regions of Maharashtra. And after all that he has done to his country and his people, he still lives in a 1BHK apartment in&nbsp;<strong>Andheri</strong>&nbsp;like a simple man. This is too little of possession for an artist of his caliber, but he seems to be too content in the lifestyle he leads and will continue to work for his people.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Widely known for her comic roles in Bollywood movies and being a judge on various comedy shows, Archana Puran Singh is a name that needs no introduction. Well, Singh and her actor-husband, Parmeet Sethi’s majestic bungalow is gaining eye-balls and doing rounds on the Internet. Let us take a virtual tour of Archana Puran Singh House, beautifully designed Madh Island bungalow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Archana Puran Singh is popular for being the judge on <em>The Kapil Sharma Show</em> and known for her jolly nature, both onscreen and offscreen. She has acted in some of the greatest A-listed Bollywood movies of all times, like Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Mohabbatein, Kick and Raja Hindustani. Singh has shared screen space with leading B-town actors, including Akshay Kumar, Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Amitabh Bachchan, Salman Khan and many others. She was also a part of the famous TV serial Shrimaan Shrimati.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While most Mumbaikars were locked up in their matchbox-sized apartments amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, Archana Puran Singh and Parmeet Sethi enjoyed spending some quality family time at their dreamy residence. However, the lockdown did not stop Archana from entertaining her fans. She kept her fans hooked to her Instagram handle by sharing adorable, funny pictures and videos of her family, housekeeping staff and pets. Along with that, we also got a close look at the lavish property owned by the couple that makes us completely mesmerised. Well, it sure made us envy them a bit, but looking at how hard they have worked in the entertainment industry for decades, they truly deserve all these luxuries. It is fair to say that even some of the greatest Bollywood celebrities cannot afford to have such a luxurious life as <strong>Archana Puran Singh</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What is the view from Archana Puran Singh House &amp; balcony?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Kuch Kuch Hota Hai actress shared an Instagram video showing us the view from her balcony that is simply the star of her property. The view of refreshing lush greenery all around with high-rise buildings in the background is a treat to the eyes, and fans could not stop gushing over it. A closer look at her balcony view highlights the stunning white patio set, adding to the scenic beauty. Singh further mentions that she likes to enjoy her alone time sitting on her balcony and getting in some cool breeze when it is too hot to go outside.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Archana Puran Singh&#8217;s Lush Green Lawn</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Behind the Singh-Sethi&nbsp;bungalow, they have a lush garden with a plethora of plants and trees, vibrant flowers and benches. Singh shared a video showing Parmeet and her son spending quality time with their adorable dog named Drama in their beautiful garden. While Singh likes to sit, sip and chat with her 90-year-old mother, Sethi and the kids prefer to work it out hard in the stunning garden at the same time.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Plush Garden at Archana Puran Singh’s Property</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Archana Puran Singh&nbsp;and&nbsp;Parmeet Sethi&nbsp;own a very spacious property that is no less than a resort. Their&nbsp;Madh Island&nbsp;residence has a wide and long walkway in the garden area filled with lovely lush green plants. The paved path is perfect for morning and evening walks. Singh also gave us a virtual tour of her beautiful garden through an Instagram post where she was seen walking around the lush garden accompanied by their cute dog, Drama. All we could think is, who would not like to reside here?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In some of Singh&#8217;s IG videos, we can see another small garden adjoining the lavish one. This garden seems to be devoted to growing vegetables, tomatoes, brinjal, capsicum, to name a few. Adding to that, Singh&#8217;s backyard is filled with trees of fruits like coconut, plum, papaya, mango, etc. It shows Singh and Sethi&#8217;s love and passion for gardening and nature. A glimpse of the fresh produce from their garden is seen in some of her videos.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Archana Puran Singh’s Property: The Front Entrance</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Out of the many videos shared by&nbsp;Archana Puran Singh&nbsp;on her Instagram handle, one video shows a sneak peek of her stunning&nbsp;bungalow&nbsp;from outside. In this video, her mother was waving to her from the grand front stoop. It has a gated entrance with a huge doorway. The interiors seemed aesthetically pleasing and definitely well-lit with striking chandeliers. The stunning french windows and bougainvillaea plant give it a complete royal residence look.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;A royal affair in the living room</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Archana Puran Singh&nbsp;and&nbsp;Parmeet Singh&#8217;s lavish&nbsp;bungalow<strong>&nbsp;</strong>has a mesmerising living room. Furnished with a white modish couch, trendy lights, and a centrally placed chandelier, Singh&#8217;s living room is what dreams are made of. Also, one cannot miss the mirrors on the walls and wall paintings in the background that add to the room&#8217;s royal aura.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Luxe Master Bedroom</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Archana Puran Singh&#8217;s fans get a glimpse of the luxurious and spacious master bedroom of her&nbsp;bungalow&nbsp;time and again through her IG videos. Singh&#8217;s bedroom gives classy Boho vibes with a simple pastel palette, clean, white cotton linen and a wicker-designed bed. The room decor shows the star&#8217;s love for subtle colours like white and baby pink. One of the videos where Singh&#8217;s domestic help, Bhagyashree, was in the limelight- the video highlighted the room&#8217;s beautifully done modern furniture like the bedroom chair and table set, recliner chair, artwork on the wall and the hanging lights. In another picture posted by Singh, we see her other canine friend &#8216;Patch&#8217; resting under the bed like a boss.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The actress left her fans spellbound with her meticulously modern designed room interior. Adorned with a comfy white L-shaped lounge sofa set, white mirrored closets behind it and beige coloured curtains, the room has an austere look. Adding to the room&#8217;s grandeur was the metallic gold furniture and door handles, a centrally placed stylish hanging ceiling lamp and the huge flatscreen TV mounted on the wall.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Lobby Area</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In one of the IG videos shared by Singh, we catch the cute banter between Bhagyashree and another member of the housekeeping staff, Raj. We also notice the beautiful lobby area just outside Singh and Sethi&#8217;s luxurious master bedroom. It has a formal table and revolving chair set-up. A notice board is also placed on the side, and it might be the space for work-related discussions. It leads to the staircase with a spandrel decorated with artistic paintings, comfy chairs and lamps, giving it a classy look altogether. The video also depicts the friendly relation Singh, and her family members have with their housekeeping staff.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What’s the Buzz around their Pet Room?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Recently,&nbsp;Archana Puran Singh&nbsp;posted a lovely Instagram picture where she introduced her fans to their two adorable pets, Patch and Drama, who love lounging around the royal bungalow. They were lazing around in a classic white and gold coloured room with pink-grey draping, white rugs and modern furniture. With an old school four-post wooden bed, a mounted wall TV set and a blue moving comfy recliner chair- is the perfect place to unwind at the end of a long day. Singh wanted to clear the misconception among her fans that her dogs do not have any place to chill inside their home. The picture shows Patch lazing on his cosy rug while Drama is literally chilling on the cold floor, licking and drooling all over. It shows the couple&#8217;s love for their pets.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Modular Kitchen</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Singh&#8217;s&nbsp;Madh Island residence has a huge kitchen space, as seen in one of her Instagram videos featuring Bhagyashree and her son. The kitchen area is as elegant as the rest of the bungalow, with white cabinets and round-patterned wall tiles. The ceiling lights highlight this space, and we cannot get our eyes off them. The area is spacious enough, allowing proper air circulation with a designed kitchen chimney. It also has a small TV mounted on the wall to keep them entertained while cooking.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Instagram-Worthy Home Décor</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Along with their acting skills, the Singh-Sethi couple also seems to have a good eye for design and architecture, as seen from the nook and corners of their&nbsp;Madh Island property. The interiors of their house are as wonderful and beautiful as the garden outside. In one of the videos shared by Singh, where she thanked her fans for their love, support and positivity, we caught a glimpse of her stunning interiors with a mix of subtle colours. The soft baby pink and grey curtains, the beautiful lampshade by her side and the white vase with lovely pink flowers compliment each other well and give the room a serene look. Singh further mentioned how she does not mind being called old and takes it very casually.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Archana Puran Singh Family: Sharing Festive Vibes</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In another IG video posted during Diwali, we see Singh celebrate and share some cheerful moments with Parmeet, her mother, her sons and the housekeeping staff at their lavish abode. Adding to the completely classy look is the stylish wall lamp, beige sofa set, large windows with flowy white curtains and the big artwork in the background.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Singh-Sethi Couple like to Keep it Cool</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As&nbsp;Madh Island is too close to the sea, the Singh-Sethi residence might be humid during summers. To counter this, Archana and Parmeet try to maintain a cosy, easy-breezy and serene set-up at their place. The dream house is perfectly balanced with whites, powder blue and just the right accents of gold. We also notice several houseplants at the celebrity&#8217;s bungalow that help maintain the cool.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Movie Nights at Archana Puran Singh&#8217;s Posh Abode</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of Singh&#8217;s Instagram posts shows the huge flatscreen TV mounted on the wall.&nbsp;Archana Puran Singh&#8217;s family&nbsp;probably chills here together during a movie night. The all-white TV bench paired with the golden-white wall lamp gives it a complete royal look.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Singh-Sethi&nbsp;bungalow<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is a class apart with loads of classic white upholstery and furnishing and no loud colour, giving a royal look throughout. Maintaining such an enormous property with eye-catching interiors would most definitely be difficult, but the couple has proved to do a tremendous job at it. Singh and Sethi&#8217;s plush&nbsp;Madh Island&nbsp;property has aced the residence game undoubtedly and has given us some major house goals. Living at such a majestic and luxurious residence would be a dream come true for many of us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">Hyderabad</span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">, the city of pearls, was made the hub of the Telugu film industry in the early 1990s. As a result, all the prestigious studios of Tollywood, actors, actresses, etc., made this city their home. In addition, big names like Prabhas, Vijay Deverkonda, Mahesh Babu, Samantha Akkineni, etc., made <strong>Hyderabad </strong>their residing place. All these <strong>celebrity homes in Hyderabad</strong> are majorly found in <strong>Jubilee Hills</strong>, one of the posh localities for the &#8216;<strong>Hyderabad property</strong>&#8216; catalogs.</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">When we are discussing the <strong>celebrity homes in Hyderabad</strong>, the one house that cannot miss our eyes is the palatial house of Mahesh Babu and Namrata Shirodkar in <strong>Jubilee Hills</strong>. It&#8217;s grand, luxurious, speaks of comfort, space, and is nothing short of a dream. So, let&#8217;s have a virtual tour of the house and soothe our eyes as we go along, and perhaps, take some notes for our future dream house!</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">Mahesh Babu Home:</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">Ghattamaneni Mahesh Babu is undeniably one of the most famous and sought-after actors in Tollywood. He is immensely talented and has been active since 1979 in the Telugu film industry. Thanks to his good looks, he is referred to as the ‘Prince’ of the Telugu film industry. Having been considered one of the best actors, he is highly paid and so when we are discussing his house, we shouldn’t be expecting anything less.</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">One of the luxurious houses in <strong>Jubilee Hills, Hyderabad</strong>, is owned by the <strong>Mahesh Babu family</strong>. The exteriors of the house are surely jaw-dropping. It is subtle but grand in look with white and grey walls and door-size sliding glass balcony windows. It matches well with the lush green garden on one side and a parking space on the other side.</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">This <strong>Hyderabad property </strong>has an indoor swimming pool, open spaces, a cozy study room, gymnasium, green gardens, a private office for Mahesh. In addition, the actor and his wife, Namrata Shirodkar, have customized other spots in the house like the living room, the puja room, the children&#8217;s room, etc., according to the tastes of the family. </span><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">Every corner of the house screams luxury and comfort. What makes it best? Every element is quite subtle and soothing. We don&#8217;t see bright or vibrant colours inside the house. Shades of beige, brown, white, etc., dominate the walls, furniture, etc., but they are well contrasted yet matched with each other. </span><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">Mahesh Babu Family:</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">Mahesh Babu is the son of a Telugu actor and director, Krishna. Carrying on his father&#8217;s legacy, Mahesh started acting in films from childhood and has been loved as an actor since then. He met Namrata Shirodkar on one of the film sets in 2000, and after dating for a couple of years, they got married in 2005. Since then, the duo has been setting couple-goals. Amidst their ambitious career, they have remained loyal and dedicated to each other and have succeeded in building up a luxurious life for themselves. They are doting parents to a son, and a daughter, and their family is strongly bound by love, culture, and laughter. The family also includes two pet dogs – Nubo and Pluto. </span><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">As they all are avid social media users, they keep dropping snaps from bits and corners of the house. Thanks to the pets, we get a clear view of the open garden in the house. The lush green grass is well synchronized with the trees and plants of different shapes and sizes. Sitting arrangements are made on one side of the garden. The floor is laid with grey wooden planks. There is a white marble table in the center which is surrounded by matching white sofa sets. The whole arrangement stands in perfect contrast to the dark green trees in the background.</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">In another snap, we see a different sitting arrangement by the side of the garden. The flooring is the same, but we see wooden plank benches. This again matches well with the lush green background. Varieties of plants and trees find their space in the garden, and hence, together, they put up a beautiful background with different shades of green. It is the best play area for the pets and the children, but it could also be a perfect tea spot for the family on a cozy evening.</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">Mahesh Babu Kids:</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">Mahesh Babu and Namrata Shirodkar have been blessed with a son, Gautam Ghattamaneni, and a daughter, Sitara Ghattamaneni. The kids have doting parents, and they seem to enjoy all the love and attention showered on them. Mahesh Babu and Namrata Shirodkar, through their love for their children, multiply the comfort and protection of their house in their lives.</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">In a few photos of Mahesh and Namrata with their kids, we get glimpses of their house. In a snap, which seems like one corner of the living room, there is a huge glass window with white curtains. There is a one-seater brown leather sofa just in front of the window. A wooden cabinet behind the couch and the shade of wood match the shade of the leather. The floor is wooden, again matching the shade of the cabinet and the sofa. To bring out a contrasting effect, there is a light brown carpet on the floor. The carpet successfully breaks the monotony of the browns and also matches with the curtain behind.</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">A huge glass wall shields the entrance from the garden into the house, and this area has another sitting arrangement overlooking the garden. There are small center tables in black which are surrounded by easy chairs of a light brown shade. There is another sofa set with brown arm-rests and ash grey cushions. They look super comfortable and would make anyone want to sink into them on a windy evening.</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">The children&#8217;s room is going to make every child envy Gautam and Sitara. Disney characters are painted on the wall with a white bed standing in perfect contrast to the wall. The curtains in the room are printed in different colours, and they match the colourful characters on the wall. The bed, on the other hand, matches the rest of the walls in the room. All in all, the children&#8217;s section is colourful and beautifully coordinated with each other.</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">Mahesh and Namrata spend a lot of time with their children. The area where Mahesh plays video games with his son is spacious. It gives a broader view of the hallway. There is a TV on a dark chocolate colour cabinet. The floor is again wooden. Other doors in the house are all of the same dark chocolate colour. But for a change, pink colour sofas are present in this area. Surprisingly, they don&#8217;t look out of place. Rather they enhance the beauty of the area.</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">The swimming pool overlooks the garden through a glass window. It has stairs leading into it on the opposite end. The wall above the pool is grey, and the lighting is subtle, which makes the water in the pool shine and look brighter.</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">Namrata Shirodkar family:</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">Namrata was born in a Marathi-speaking family, but she became famous for some of her roles in Bollywood. She quit acting because she wanted to marry Mahesh Babu and she is a proud mother and an excellent wife.</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">She gave glimpses of the puja room in the house. It is small but well-lit and spaced out. There is a white marble temple against a golden wall. On either side of the temple are glass windows overlooking the outer spaces. The floor is white too, and it serves well with the purpose of the place, adding to the serenity and peace.</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">As Gautam and Sitara celebrated their birthdays, Namrata gave glimpses of some other corners of the house. Where the table is golden, the walls are decorated with paintings. The chairs are beige. The floor and walls are white. The hall is subtly lit with golden lights, which creates a beautiful ambience. To break the monotony of the whites and beige, all the doors and painting frames are dark chocolate.</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">Memories are an essential part of human lives. Therefore, having a memory wall in a house is fair. The memory wall in Mahesh and Namrata&#8217;s house is white. It has a good number of photo frames. There is a double seater black sofa just in front of the memory wall on a light printed carpet. This is the best place in the house to relax and reminisce about the good old times.</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">Namrata Shirodkar Property:</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">The combined net worth of Mahesh Babu and Namrata Shirodkar is approximately 100 crores. It boosts their king-size living. The working space in the house is appropriate for a working environment, with a white table and a matching white working chair. The setup stands in contrast to the dark brown cabinet in the background, a perfect place for storing books and files.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">Reading is for everyone. Comfortable reading space is what facilitates good reading habits. The reading space in this house of <strong>Jubilee Hills</strong> has a comfortable grey-coloured sofa with a small side table. The cushions, the side table, and the cabinet behind are in different shades of brown and black, while the wall behind is olive green.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">The living room is of utmost importance in every house. Not to mention again, but the living room of Mahesh and Namrata’s house is luxurious, cozy, and well-designed. The home theatre is set against a light shade of wallpaper and the cabinet is a dark shade of brown, while the floor is a light shade of brown. There is a printed carpet on the floor and the sofa set is in the shade of beige which mixes well with the ambience. </span><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u><span style="color: #0e101a;">Other corners in the property</span></u><span style="color: #0e101a;">:</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">Fitness is important, and hence, the gymnasium is well-equipped with all the necessary machines for home-workout. There is a huge television on one wall. Another wall has a poster of Mahesh Babu with an inspirational quote written. It is well-lit and overlooks the outer space through a glass window again. </span><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">The sofa, the couch, the walls, and the carpet are all in the shades of beige. To break the monotony, a dark coloured center table is present, along with brightly printed cushions.</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">There is another open space inside the house that looks like a division between two house sections. The floor is marbled. There are plants on both sides of the space. The two sections of the house are connected by a bridge that overlooks the marble floor beneath. But this area is again a good play space for the pets.</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u><span style="color: #0e101a;">Conclusion</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span style="text-decoration: none;"> </span></span></u></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">We keep getting glimpses of the house now and then through various social media posts. Every corner of the house is decorated beautifully. Nothing is vibrant, yet nothing is dull. This house uses a smart combination of lighting and colour contrasts to bring out a rich and luxurious look. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">The best thing is that every family member’s requirements and tastes are met. If there is an office for the elders, then the children have their separate rooms. The entertainment section is kept separate from the video games section, hence no interruption to anyone. The reading space is there to preach knowledge, while the puja area is there to preach culture. </span><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">Who would need anything else if there is an open garden with several comfortable sitting areas? It could fit any mood, weather, and it is surely the best hangout spot in the house.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Celebrity homes are as soothing to the eyes as the sound of the ocean to the ears. Many times we see celebrity homes as goals, but let&#8217;s make one thing clear, that is, no dream home comes to you all of a sudden. Just like every posh homeowner, one has to be working hard enough to make a living so lavish and glamorous. Welcome to Suriya and Jyothika&#8217;s home! Without further ado, let&#8217;s take a tour of their ultra-luxurious abode.</em></strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Jyothika and Suriya&#8217;s Family-</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Suriya is a well-known Indian Film Actor and producer, married to Jyothika, who has been announced as Zee Tamil Channel&#8217;s first-ever brand Ambassador. They have children named Dev and Diya. The actor plus producer&#8217;s first film was Nerrukku Ner in 1997 and that&#8217;s not it. Quite a number of films have gotten Suriya and Jyothika&#8217;s family their top-notch, merging style abode. This celebrity home consists of spaces one can surely dream about and work towards. So if you have no idea what your dream home should look like, let us take you through a tour in and around the celebrity home that is situated in Chennai’s poshest locality. The actor, as we know, emerges from a huge acting background with father being an actor, brother, Karthik Sivakumar a successful actor, and sister, Brindha Sivakumar, who is a singer in the Indian film industry. Coming from a background filled with actors and singers, Suriya sure had his way through the industry as we all know that talent and skills never go unnoticed. He has and will always be known for his brilliant acting skills and his nurturing nature towards people.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>AGARAM Foundation- </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Suriya Sivakumar also brings hope to the world by opening a charity organization for the under-privileged providing them quality education. The Foundation is known as Agaram Foundation and is founded by the actor himself where people from all over the world can contribute to help the underprivileged children. Agaram Vidhai is a part of the foundation where the under-privileged are not only given quality education but are also given mentoring, training workshops, employability and placement training to help succeed in life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This foundation also helps people get jobs as they hire candidates or volunteers to help provide services to the underprivileged. The mission of this beautifully created foundation is to build new opportunities for the new generation of responsible youth by providing quality education, values, commitment, and dedication to society.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Interesting facts about Jyothika and Suriya Shivakumar&#8217;s Abode</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Suriya&#8217;s home is not just massive, but it is lavish, mixing the concept of style and elegance, but there&#8217;s surely more to it than just being lavish, isn&#8217;t there? Suriya and Jyothika Shivakumar&#8217;s family now resides in a bungalow situated in Chennai. The bungalow is located on Vijayalakshmi Street which is known to be one of the poshest areas in Chennai. Suriya and Jyothika’s home is exposed to lush greens and Chennai’s skyline.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The garden, perfectly landscaped, is situated right at the entrance which in turn gives Jyothika and Suriya&#8217;s home a welcoming appeal. Jyothika&#8217;s family has set up the garden so beautifully with flowers and plants which seem to also welcome a variety of birds. Imagine waking up to a chirping sound- a pure bliss! The garden in Jyothika and Suriya&#8217;s home is also where Suriya spends most of his time playing with his children.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the house opens up, we get to see their bungalow&#8217;s lavish living room where Suriya is mostly seen spending his free time post his shoots. Suriya and his family spend most of their time bonding in that living area and not just that, Jyothika&#8217;s gatherings are also a part of the living area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The living room is seen to have elegant and various artworks on its walls along with antiques on tabletops, and Divans for relaxing. Divans is a type of bed with only a thick base to lie but has no frame at either end. Jyothika and Suriya&#8217;s home is a home where interiors have out-marked the rest, with well-lit and soothing to the eye home decor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let&#8217;s bring the flooring in the picture now &#8211; The floors are seen to be designed with quality marble that literally shines like glass. Imagine walking on glass, which is what walking around in Jyothika and Suriya&#8217;s home feels like.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moving on to the kitchen, the lavish living area now leads you to the kitchen where Suriya and Jyothika cook various types of dishes, together. The ingredient to a happy family? Agree? A family that cooks together, eats together and sleeps together, basically follows any discipline together, stays together! Now aren&#8217;t these couple goals? Or let&#8217;s just say family goals!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All we can say is, a celebrity home doesn&#8217;t always have to be <em>MASSIVE</em> or <em>LARGE</em> but having a cozy yet branded home is luxurious, in our dictionary, too!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Suriya&#8217;s Chennai Home Decor</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Suriya and Jyothika&#8217;s family is clearly obsessed with nature as their abode has glass walls and expansive windows to enjoy the vistas of nature. Suriya’s family surely believes in a dining area hence the bungalow consists of a plush dining room which is also known to be large and accommodates a huge dining table that consists of seating for 8 people. With white and golden shade carpet and a wooden dining table with decor that says ‘<em>High-Class only’</em>, makes it a dining area of a lifetime. Orange and beige seats and hanging round lamps right above the dining table adds an edge. We wonder if both are involved in the decor or is it just Jyothika’s vibe!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A bungalow and no stairs? Not possible. Suriya&#8217;s Chennai home holds a majestic staircase that leads you to the upper floor. Their bedrooms are designed no less than a 5-star hotel. The feels, the decor, the shades used for furnishing, all add up and make it look classy and sassy! With an outstanding interior and a pinch of metallic hues, is what combines the bedroom of Jyothika and Suriya&#8217;s home. What&#8217;s even cooler is the two-step staircase in the bedroom which, even to look at, gives elegance as a whole, to the house.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Glass openings lead you to the balcony, which is mostly extremely dreamy and offers a beautiful view of greenery. Waking up to such a vibe is bliss indeed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A celebrity home and no theatre room? That sounds bizarre! Well, that isn&#8217;t the case at Jyothika and Suriya&#8217;s home. This celebrity home consists of a mini-theatre room where Jyothika and Suriya&#8217;s family is seen having a good time of their life. As the bungalow is being explored, it is pretty clear how this Sivakumar family likes to spend time with each other and bond. That&#8217;s a celebrity home for you guys!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Suriya and Jyothika&#8217;s family does seem all about fun and bonding but when it comes to spending a few hours being grateful to the lord, Suriya has an enclave dedicated to spiritual pursuits. The bungalow is seen to have space specifically for a temple with various idols and where the family performs spiritual rituals and pujas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Bungalow consists of a couple of guest rooms in order to accommodate guests when they are over at Jyothika&#8217;s and Suriya&#8217;s celebrity home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A celeb home walk-in wardrobe is exactly what Suriya and Jyothika hold at their place. A wardrobe that opens up to a room full of clothes, dressing tables, mirrors, etc. it’s all here which consists of numerous shelves, an area for hanging their high-end branded clothes, and show racks positioned well in the wardrobe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The whole bungalow, when seen from the outside, looks in the shape of a ship, at least to us, with colours like blue and all its shades on it. It is pleasing to the eyes, it is massive and blue. Every room in their house has a different vibe to mingle and that is the beauty of this celebrity home. Nothing is connected, it is a different space, a different vibe altogether.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Nayanthara</strong> is one of the most coveted <strong>superstars</strong> in the South film industry. The Kollywood actress shot to fame with two successful movies Manassinakkare (2003) and Ayya (2005), as her debut in Malayalam and Tamil industry. Being at par with her beauty, her fans can be sure of being awestruck by her abode located in <strong>Hyderabad</strong>. <strong>Nayanthara’s house</strong>, a high-end apartment, is no less than what one would expect from the famous <strong>celeb’s home.</strong> Every detail in the house speaks volumes about this celebrity’s style and majestic way of living. Though having passed her prime age, the actress does not shy away from breaking barriers, whether they are with respect to playing roles in female-centric movies to standing her ground regarding the gap in gender pay scale.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A Star is Born </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This superstar does not need an introduction. Her achievements speak for her hard work in the Kollywood film industry. The laurels that she has brought from a very young age are worth complimenting and genuinely impeccable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The journey of a brown-haired Diana, who was the epitome of an average girl trying to fit into the world of stars to become <strong>Nayanthara</strong>, the Lady <strong>Superstar</strong> of the Kollywood industry, has made the entire south fan-following quite curious. <strong>Nayanthara</strong> was 19 years old when she entered the world of acting, and since then, nothing has stopped this <strong>superstar</strong> from achieving her dreams. She went on from working as a part time-model to being voted as the “Most Desirable Woman in Chennai” by a leading publisher in Southern India.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Born as Diana Mariam Kurian, the actress later changed her name to <strong>Nayanthara</strong> and converted to Hinduism. She started as a model in college and was the first runner up of Best Model Kerala in 2003. At that time, she was pursuing her bachelor&#8217;s degree in English Literature from Marthoma College, Thiruvalla. She was later on discovered by the director Satyan Athnikkad who gave her a prominent role in the Malayali film Manassinakkare in 2003. She appeared as a debutant in this movie, which turned out to be a blockbuster.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having worked in more than 75 films in the Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam cinema, Nayanthara has earned a substantial fan following over the years. She is one of the few actresses who has worked with nearly all the leading actors in the Kollywood film industry. From Rajnikanth, Vijay Sethupathi to Dhanush, <strong>Nayanthara</strong> has worked with the best Kollywood actors and has maintained her spot, which is at the top, for nearly two decades.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Out of the 68 awards that <strong>Nayanthara</strong> has been nominated for, the talented actress has won 66 of them.  Her exceptional work in Sri Rama Rajyam (2011) was highly appreciated and won her the Filmfare Award for Best Telugu Actress and the Nandi Award for Best Actress. In addition, the actress had won three Filmfare awards for her outstanding performance in three movies, each from Tamil, Malayalam, and Telugu cinema.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Lesser Known Facts About Nayanthara’s Life</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also known as the Lady superstar, she has been a part of the 2018 Forbes India celebrity 100 list with an earning close to ₹15.17 crores. Nayanthara has bagged the title of one of the highest-paid actresses in the South film Industry. Owing to her splendid performances, she charges approximately ₹3 crores for each movie.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Nayanthara</strong> was initially raised as a Syrian Christian, but on August 7, 2011, the actress went through Shuddhi Karma, a procedure that consists of Vedic purification and chanting of Hymns from the Vedas and Gayatri Mantra.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another interesting fact about the south queen is that she is a polydactyl. She has a sixth finger on her hand, which is rudimentary, quite like the Bollywood star, Hrithik Roshan.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Nayanthara’s Mystery Abode</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She does not have an account on any social media platform, keeping her private life all to herself. We seldom see pictures of <strong>Nayanthara</strong>&#8216;s magnificent house doing rounds, either. The actress believes in living in peace without much flaunting on social media. Yet her strong persona keeps the paparazzi on the run, always wanting a little more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nayanthara has been all over the news for numerous reasons, one of them being her refusal to buy a permanent home in Chennai. She stated the reason behind this decision is nothing but security.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is believed that <strong>Nayanthara’s house</strong> is located only in <strong>Hyderabad</strong>. Thus, the celebrity&#8217;s home is where she resides to gain solace and solitude. Considering Hyderabad to be where the celeb&#8217;s home belongs, she prefers to stay in hotels while shooting for films in Chennai.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Some interesting facts about Nayanthara’s Home Decor</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Nayanthara’</strong>s house reflects her radiant personality. From the Italian marble-laden shiny floors to the high ceiling, everything mirrors grandiose and luxury. Situated in Hyderabad, this celeb&#8217;s home has the most aesthetically pleasing home décor pieces and artefacts that seem to be handpicked from various places. The luxurious space has a broad and open look to it. Everything from the furniture to the tiniest bauble appears to be at the perfect spot, and every element of the house is no less beautiful than the other. The walls are primarily off-white with yellow ceiling lights to complement the décor. All the cushioning, including the couch and the chair covers, are of neutral tone colour. The actress has cherry-picked neutral and muted colours for the furniture too. The false ceiling and the LED lighting together give a very royal and chic look to the place.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Luxurious but Subtle</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main seating area has elegant white sofas with contrasting cushions that speak of comfort yet luxury. To add to the exuberant lifestyle of the actor, her room is adorned with glass sculptures that add a touch of vibrancy to this space, making it a centrepiece for all the parties hosted by her. With a television screen and wall speakers opposite the sofas, one can imagine <strong>Nayanthara</strong> watching one of her favourite movies in this spacious room which is nothing less than a private movie screening.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Behind the heavy curtains drawn on the glass doors is the balcony overlooking the trees and plants. The green area surrounding Nayanthara’s house spreads serenity and also helps the busy actress spend a little time in seclusion, away from the city’s hustle and bustle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dining area of this celeb’s home is just as magnificent as her style. Embellished with a breathtaking chandelier, the luminescence adds an edge. The kind of lighting in every part of the house is very well thought of and gives each room a different vibe. The dining area is connected to the main seating spot since the apartment spans over a large area. The interconnectedness of the dining and lobby makes the apartment seem large and extravagant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All the bedrooms have a subtle décor with warm colours that are pleasing to the eye. From the exquisite curtains hanging in every room to the glass doors that open to fresh air, Nayanthara has not spared a penny to make this <strong>Hyderabad</strong> property an eye-turner. Ventilation is the most crucial factor in buying a house, and this celebrity&#8217;s home is the best example of that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The spacious rooms have a separate seating area of their own. With recliner chairs and glass tables, the room itself has a world of its own. The walls of the bedrooms have a soothing white colour without the loudness of wallpapers. This can also be read as the actress&#8217;s choice of living, simple yet large.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The rooms oversee a scenic view that the actress can enjoy looking at through the huge glass doors. Or she can step out onto the balcony and spend a relaxing evening with nature.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A Socially friendly Kitchen </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Contrary to keeping the kitchen a separate hidden space from the rest of the rooms, <strong>Nayanthara’s</strong> <strong>house</strong> has a huge open kitchen, overseeing the dining area. Adopting a contemporary concept of kitchen designs, the celebrity&#8217;s home has a modular look to it. The elements of modern design used to build this celeb&#8217;s kitchen are worth flaunting. A large tabletop with high stools is present so that cooking does not remain a lonely job but can be done overlooking the liveliness of the rest of the house. A sleek island unit in the middle of the kitchen is another concept adapted from the western interiors.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Epitome of Elegance</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The balcony houses a large hanging swing, which can frequently be spotted in <strong>Nayanthara’s </strong>pictures. The balcony floor is covered with shining, new artificial grass that adds an aesthetic value to space, giving it a complete mini garden-like look.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The surrounding environment and atmosphere are perfect for the actress to practice yoga in her spare time and indulge in self-care. Moreover, the sunlight coming across from the glass doors would make a perfect morning for the actress to start her day afresh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ornaments and furnishings in<strong> Nayanthara’s house</strong> cover every table and flat surface present in the house. These ornaments vary from colourful potted plants to beautiful mini sculptures that add to the radiance of her home. The abundance of house-plants surely points towards the celeb&#8217;s love for nature and its beauty. There is no over-the-top bling to the house. All the decorations are subtle and elegant.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Not all Glitter</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is so much more to Nayanthara&#8217;s house than just fancy walls, glamour, and glitter. It has a sense of peace and calm. No doubt, she travels back to <strong>Hyderabad</strong> after her work to have a peaceful time at a place that she can call home. A home is a place that brings us solace. <strong>Nayanthara</strong> has built herself an apartment just like that. The homeliness of the plush furniture to the ornaments that represent a celebrity&#8217;s house is all a blend and balance of the perfect ingredients that one dreams of having in a home they wish to live in. The Queen of Kollywood sure knows how to live life Queen Size.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>A house is more than simply a place to live; it encapsulates all of life&#8217;s joys and sorrows, and it echoes all of the past&#8217;s splendours. This is what makes it a home. It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s ours or someone else&#8217;s. But, when someone else is a Bollywood superstar (Kiara Advani), the house takes on a whole new meaning. It encapsulates the opulence and glamour that surrounds superstars.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we think of<strong> celebrity homes</strong>, we immediately think of the lavish, luxurious, spacious and well-decorated bungalows with an undeniable extravagance. Whether you&#8217;re seeking design ideas or just fantasising about your ultimate ideal home, some <strong>celeb homes</strong> are a great place to start. The efforts of designers and architects who work with them are immense, and they go above and beyond to make celebrities’ abodes as extraordinary and beautiful as possible. Some of the best and the most popular Bollywood celebrities&#8217; homes are <em>Mannat</em>, the residence of Shahrukh Khan, <em>Jalsa</em> and <em>Pratiksha</em> of Amitabh Bachan, Salman Khan&#8217;s <em>Galaxy Heights</em> and the list goes on. Whenever tourists arrive in Mumbai, it is almost always the case that they visit these iconic homes and treat themselves to a peak from outside. It has almost become a tradition for people to look up to their success and admire their ultra-luxurious abodes. Today, let’s take a virtual tour of the talented actress, Kiara Advani’s brand new apartment nestled in the suburb Mahalaxmi area of Mumbai.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though she is fairly new in the fraternity, her achievement speaks volume about her talent and flair. Kiara Advani&#8217;s acting abilities and flexibility are taking her to great heights. It appears that acting has always run in her veins. She once shared in her cover interview with Vogue magazine that she was a full Hindi film buff in a school where it was &#8216;cool&#8217; to watch English films. Every time her friends contacted her, she would flip to an English channel. When no one was looking, she would listen to Govinda songs and deliver dialogues from Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She first appeared in front of the camera at the very tender age of eight years while shooting an advertisement for baby cream along with her mother. Well, most famous for her breakout role as Priti in Kabir Singh, Kiara Advani is on an unstoppable roll of delivering one blockbuster after another. She made her debut in Fugly and has even acted in 2 Telugu movies. After spreading her roots in the soils of Bollywood, she even left a mark on the OTT platform with the movie ‘Guilty’ and gave a critically acclaimed performance in ‘Lust Stories,’ both of which were directed by Karan Johar. Apart from having a family which has strong connections with Bollywood big shots, she was also fortunate to be mentored by Salman Khan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This stunning actress has fourteen million followers on Instagram alone, and all of them are always trying to catch a glimpse of her not so &#8216;humble&#8217; abode. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kiara Advani lives at the Planet Godrej building in Mahalaxmi, which is one of the area&#8217;s high-end developments. Planet Godrej&#8217;s apartments provide stunning 360-degree views of the Mahalaxmi Racecourse, the magnificent Haji Ali Mosque, and the much-loved Arabian Sea. The Mahalaxmi Race Course and the gorgeous Arabian Sea are seen from Advani&#8217;s property. Now, without any further ado, let&#8217;s quickly dive into this beautiful apartment. Have a Glance!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Living room with all-white aesthetics</strong><strong> </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Starting with the imperative part of the house, which is the living room. The living room gives out the first glimpse of the interiors of an abode, therefore it is indispensable to design this space magnificently, and it should be true to the owner&#8217;s personality. Kiara Advani&#8217;s plush living room is nothing less than perfection as it oozes her vibe and aesthetic sense. This area is lit up with natural sunlight with floor-to-wall ceiling windows, allowing fresh air to enter which helps in keeping the place buoyant. It provides a panoramic view of the Mahalaxmi race course and Mumbai’s skyline. The whole theme of the room is white with a splash of gold. This is a great choice of colour because white creates an illusion of space and gives a bright aura to the room. The room is decorated with a huge white leather couch. She has added a white faux fur carpet to top off the whole decor, giving it a luxurious yet comfy feel. There is a huge potted plant next to the sofa, which adds a pop of colour. The couch is also laden with fancy plush pink and silver cushions. The wall directly above the sofa has a collection of mirrors which also helps in decluttering the space. Lastly, to bind all these elements together, the entire room is adorned with a textured gold wall. This whole decor is sure to give the guests an accurate impression of Kiara Advani’s vibe and mirrors her unquestionable taste.<strong> </strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Balcony with a picturesque view</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The living room opens up to a large spacious balcony with a breathtaking view of the Mumbai skyline as well as the Arabian Sea. This alone sets this balcony class apart, but to take it a step further, Kiara did not shy away from decorating her entire balcony in white theme too. The outdoor furniture in the balcony is made up of cane material that is ideal for the outdoors. On one side of the balcony, the entire wall is textured golden, which undoubtedly adds beauty. In addition, a textured brown wall, colourful artwork in red and black colours, and gold vases provide contrast and warmth to this nook. It is quite clear from her Instagram posts that she loves to enjoy a piping hot cup of tea with her near and dear ones at the balcony spot. It is a dream for many. The balcony spot appears to be idyllic to watch Mumbai’s picturesque skyline.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Instagram and Pinterest-worthy nook</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moving on to another most pictured spot in the apartment which is tucked away in a corner of her living room. Kiara loves to take pictures of all her mesmerizing outfits and red-carpet looks in front of this Instagram and Pinterest-worthy backdrop. This spot is adorned with an overall theme of mirrors and glass. The wall is covered with mosaic style small mirrors, a side glass table decorated with roses in a silver vase and big candles that serves as a backdrop for photos taken before the red carpet.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dine like a star</strong><strong> </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many dazzling mirrors on the wall of the dining area. The modular spacious kitchen is striking and is well lit. It has white panelling all around which gives out a grandeur vibe. In addition, there are a lot of floral decorations to add colour and freshness.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kiara and her love for flowers</strong><strong> </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kiara is fond of flowers, and her love for them is quite evident from the interiors of her abode. Flowers do bring the energy of an entire place to a high. However, Kiara’s face is as beautiful as any fresh flower, and the vitality in her eyes is as dazzling as any fresh flower lighting someone&#8217;s day. Her fondness for flowery designs may be seen in the outfits she wears. Kiara looks stunning in floral designs, whether it&#8217;s a floral blouse, a floral dress, or a floral lehenga. Statement items like flowers are used to add a hint of colours and liveliness to one’s life. The flower-power keeps the place looking fresh and fragrant at all times. Kiara&#8217;s home appears to be brimming with the beauty of flowers, whether in large pots or dazzling vases. The whole layout of the apartment is smartly planned and well-executed. The formal sitting area is separated from the bedrooms by a long, well-lit corridor. This ensures the privacy of the hostess when she throws a party at her luxe abode. The corridor is laden with a lot of family and friends pictures to add a personal touch. There are also some beautiful artworks in this corridor.  With creamy wall paint and wood panelling on the ceiling, her space has an earthy hue.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Living the life of her dream</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now let&#8217;s talk about the approximate cost of the apartment. After analyzing all the nooks and corners of the house in such detail, it&#8217;s natural for fans to be curious about the cost of these lavish apartments that are located in the Mahalaxmi area of Mumbai. Planet Godrej is a collection of five residential buildings sprawling on a 9-acre (3.6-hectare) property in Mahalaxmi, Mumbai. The towers are 181 metres (594 feet) tall with 51 stories and around 300 residential flats. After doing some digging, the approximate cost of the apartment seems to be at a whopping 14- 15 crore. However, it is crucial to keep in mind that these are just approximate figures. It could easily be more or less than that. Owing to her successful career in Bollywood, it doesn&#8217;t come across as a surprise to see this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">We all know&nbsp;<strong>Chunky Pandey&nbsp;</strong>as a funny actor who is responsible for making us laugh hard through his exceptional acting skills.&nbsp;<strong>Chunky Pandey&nbsp;</strong>has made his mark in the film industry and has worked on many successful projects alongside big names. He lives in&nbsp;<strong>Mumbai&#8217;s Pali Hill&nbsp;</strong>area that is famously known for many&nbsp;<strong>celeb homes</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Chunky&nbsp;</strong>lives with his wife&nbsp;<strong>Bhavana Pandey&nbsp;</strong>and their two beautiful daughters&nbsp;<strong>Ananya Pandey&nbsp;</strong>and Rysa Pandey.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chunky Pandey&#8217;s</strong>&nbsp;<strong>house&nbsp;</strong>is a perfect exemplar of a contemporary architectural design. He has given his bungalow a minimal but appealing approach. His star daughter&nbsp;<strong>Ananya Pandey&nbsp;</strong>has also shared some sneak peeks of their stylish abode from her well-known official Instagram handle. You will find some of her pics that she has taken inside their plush home when you scroll through her account. You can also Google&nbsp;<strong>Ananya Pandey house,&nbsp;</strong>and you&#8217;ll see some stunning photos of their abode.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though the&nbsp;<strong>Pali hill&nbsp;</strong>area is packed with countless notable&nbsp;<strong>celebrity homes</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Chunky Pandey</strong>&nbsp;<strong>house&nbsp;</strong>still manages to stand out due to an assortment of aspects, some of which we&#8217;re going to look at further in the blog.&nbsp;<strong>Chunky Pandey house</strong> is structured with many luxurious amenities like a home bar, garden and a vast lounge where the whole family gets together to spend some leisure time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The house is built considering the wind directions to maximize the natural light and air ventilation throughout the structure. It also consists of an open to sky terrace, which the Pandey family often uses to rejuvenate themselves. The family additionally has pooches that live with them in one of the lush neighbourhoods of <strong>Mumbai</strong>. Ananya and Rysa are frequently seen in the living room and other areas with their pet canines. The living area is intended to look like a glasshouse, with mirrors adorning the walls. Chunky Pandey bought his opulent Pali Hill home in the 1990s when his career was at its pinnacle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In front of the cottage are numerous varieties of plants. Ananya Pandey is frequently spotted doing yoga or simply painting at her favourite station around their home garden. She also relaxes on the terrace when she has a few minutes to spare. Now, let&#8217;s go over some interesting aspects of this property that make it worth the stare.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Key Facts about Chunky Pandey’s Home Décor</strong></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Natural surrounding</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bungalow is surrounded by natural greenery, which enhances the outward view of the house. Greenery surely helps in protecting the property from severe weathering effects. This idea also assists in safeguarding the health of the occupants as fresh air leads to healthy breathing and minimizes the chances of catching an infection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, they&#8217;ve made a home garden inside, which contains diverse families of plants adding to the house&#8217;s charm. Plants are also said to be beneficial in reducing stress, which we can guess may be the reason for the Pandey family&#8217;s stress-free and attractive looks. You may have seen some Instagram pictures of <strong>Ananya Pandey&nbsp;</strong>in which she is seen roaming around their garden and clicking photos simultaneously. The modern architectural look in combination with the natural surrounding never fails to make the house look aesthetically alluring.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Correlative concept</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The house&#8217;s overall tone is very coordinated, and all parts of the building are interrelated in such a manner that adds to its beauty. All structural units like the living room, passages, bedrooms, etc., are laid out functionally to ease the accessibility aspect of the design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And the furniture used in different areas is also pretty rich looking and cohesive. For example, if we talk about the living room, Panday&#8217;s living room is full of fascinating details, despite its statement-making carpeting. The room has black and white baroque couches, velvety ebony and gold coffee table, and numerous enormous vases bursting with flowers, all in keeping with the space&#8217;s colour scheme. But wait, there&#8217;s more! The party area contains furniture that offers unexpected splashes of colour to the room, perfectly blending distinct aesthetics.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A handful of shiny yellow pots and a vintage-style side table in a cheery shade of bright blue adds a character to space. The small elements are what tie the entire area together. The elaborate gold carvings on the table, for example, coordinate with the print on the black and white couches. The cohesive approach helps in building a sophisticated image of the house without making it look contrasting.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Functional illumination</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a bustling city like Mumbai, it&#8217;s critical that one&#8217;s home feels like a hideaway with fresh air to breathe and sufficient sunlight- <strong>Ananya Pandey&#8217;s home</strong> covers all of these factors. The actress’ apartment changes into a sun-drenched paradise throughout the day, thanks to the numerous floor-to-ceiling glass doors. Open spaces are created smartly to pass the light in every part of the house. The sunlight falling on the house during the daytime fetches the classy design of the home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The doors also provide a view of the Panday&#8217;s outdoor area, which has rows and rows of plants, creating a relaxing atmosphere. Panday regularly visits the grassy spot to photograph her OOTDs before heading out to events, and she even celebrated Raksha Bandhan with her cousins there. The Panday&#8217;s also enjoy putting up their Christmas tree by the glass doors which helps in creating a pleasant festive cornucopia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Good light and air ventilation help sustain the plant life surrounding the bungalow and their interior garden. In addition, all the windows and verandahs are smartly designed to amplify the brightness all over the house.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pleasant interior décor</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No matter how great any house looks from the outside, if it is not done correctly internally, it just doesn&#8217;t pass the vibe check.&nbsp; The interior of the house is very crucial in enriching the outlook of the home. So appropriate design measures are needed to be taken while doing the home décor to enhance the residence&#8217;s internal feels. And as we are talking about <strong>Chunky Pandey’s house</strong>, it just fulfils every requirement of a perfect interior design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The interior of the house is done quite well. A look inside the Panday family&#8217;s&nbsp;<strong>Mumbai&nbsp;</strong>house reveals that it is everything but simple. While Ananya Panday&#8217;s living space is predominantly black and white, new photographs show her posing for a party in a cosy area with rich, dark green walls. How does one go about matching colours like that? The room&#8217;s furnishings are filled with black and white pieces (note the ivory couch bed and monochrome artwork), allowing the room&#8217;s dramatic walls to take centre stage. A red animal figurine on the bedside table is one of the only other sources of colour in the room. A touch of synergy is added to the home&#8217;s loo with black and white tile identical to that in the hall.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And coming to&nbsp;<strong>Ananya Pandey&#8217;s&nbsp;</strong>bedroom- gives us inspiration on how to be different from the typical yet sophisticated. The bedroom has been well decorated with oak flooring and crisp white walls. The entire bedroom has a basic feel to it. The living area features monochrome and patterned glossy flooring and vintage and nostalgic wooden interior décor motifs. The large glass windows are a major medium through which a lot of light enters, and the turquoise-hued table is embellished with gold. The rooms are decorated in sophisticated and elegant colours. Teal blue velvet chairs and couches are accented with olive green cushions. The spiral staircase leads to another peaceful spot in the house, designed to look like a loft. The overall interior essence of the house is precisely cultured which gives a contemporary vibe to the abode.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Celebration area</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This house is topped up with many luxurious amenities, one of which is their party space that is specially designed to celebrate family achievements. In Bollywood, entertainment is a major facet of life, and the Panday’s home is well-equipped for throwing B-town hottest parties.&nbsp;<strong>Chunky Pandey&#8217;s</strong>&nbsp;bar, which is also one of&nbsp;<strong>Ananya Pandey&nbsp;</strong>and mom&nbsp;<strong>Bhavana Pandey&#8217;s</strong> favourite photo spot, has to be one of the most appealing nooks. The mirrored bar is encircled by velvety violet bar seats and has its pale blue cabinet stocked with bar necessities. Although the area&#8217;s colours are dark, the glass accents on the bar blend in magnificently with a spectrum of dazzling mirrors in the living room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You may also have seen this party room in the stories posted by&nbsp;<strong>Ananya Pandey</strong>&nbsp;on Instagram<strong>, </strong>in which she is seen having fun with her friends. This area is perfect for times like lockdown when clubs and pubs in the city are shut, and there&#8217;s nowhere to go.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ending remarks</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chunky Pandey&nbsp;</strong>as an actor, has seen many ups and downs, and there was a time in his career when he had to introduce himself in the Bangladeshi film industry because of no projects in Bollywood. However, he bounced back with more energy and showed his worth to the world in the best way possible. He now owns this luxurious home in&nbsp;<strong>Mumbai&#8217;s&nbsp;</strong>suburb locality and lives with his family over there.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chunky purchased this house when he was doing well as an actor, and obviously, he&#8217;s done many changes to the property to keep its design relative to modern trends. His abode is among the top <strong>celebrity homes</strong>&nbsp;located in&nbsp;<strong>Mumbai&nbsp;</strong>that fans don&#8217;t miss out on looking. The actor also owns restaurants that he and his wife run together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bottom line is that the Pandey family home is worth a look when you are looking for&nbsp;<strong>celeb home&nbsp;</strong>inspiration to overhaul the architectural design of your house in a timeless fashion to keep the depiction relevant for years to come.</p>
