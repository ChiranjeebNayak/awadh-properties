										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-justify">The very concept of Vastu Shastra came forward during the Vedic times in India, that is the science of space and architecture that guides the people to create spaces and environment that supports their physical, mental and spiritual health and paves the way for a prosperous life. Vastu Shastra is regarded as the science of designing and building houses, offices, temples, and other living spaces. Since ancient times, energy has been considered a free-flowing creation that can neither be created nor destroyed.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">&nbsp;The transformation from one form to the other is possible. This free-flowing energy directs all the positive or negative vibes and thoughts within ourselves and our surroundings. Following the sets of rules and regulations of Vastu before entering any new place is mandatory to live a healthy and peaceful life.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Referring to our auspicious Mythology and Vedas, Vastu Shastra indicates the directions- East and North to be most blessed with positive energies; hence, North-facing homes are the most auspicious ones.<strong> Vastu Shastra for North Facing Homes </strong>is widely accepted because of the presence of Lord Kuber, also known as the God of Wealth, in the North direction. It is not only the north-facing home that brings in prosperity but the whole North-facing house planin which every direction should be planned as per the Vastu. North Facing Home Vastu includes a complete list of directions for different corners of the house that needs to be followed to attract good positive energies. The list is as follows:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Master Bedroom:</strong> Should face South-west region</li><li><strong>Pooja Room:</strong> Should be located in North-east region</li><li><strong>Living Room:</strong> Should face North-east region</li><li><strong>Guest Room:</strong> Should be in the North-west region</li><li><strong>Kitchen:</strong> Should lie in the South-east or North-west direction.</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-about-north-facing-home"><strong>About North Facing Home</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Briefly describing since the existence of humans, directions have played an essential role in assisting where, what and when to hunt, hide and migrate. Era&#8217;s changed, but directions still play a significant role in defining wealth and prosperity in human life; hence, the main entry gate of any house situated in the north direction is considered as North Facing Home that accounts for most positive energies.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-north-facing-homes-good-or-bad"><strong>Are North Facing Homes Good or Bad?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">It would not be fitting to conclude that only <strong>North Facing House Plans</strong> are the most appropriate and good ones, and the rest of the directions are not; rather, all the directions have their specialty, no direction is good or bad. People need to follow specific guidelines of <strong>Vastu Shastra for North Facing Homes </strong>to attract prosperity to their homes.</p>



<h2 id="h-location-of-main-gate-in-north-facing-house-plan"><strong>Location of Main Gate in North Facing House Plan</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In any house plan, there is always a special emphasis on the location of the main gate because it is the entrance point of the home from where either all negative or all the positive forces will enter the home. Hence its placement is the major area of concern. So, in a<strong> North Facing House Plan</strong>, the main gate should only be located in the North direction, the distance between north-east and north-west is divided into nine equal parts, where also the fifth step is the most auspicious among all because of the belief of the existence of God of Wealth there.</p>

<h2 id="h-importance-of-padas-in-vastu-shastra"><strong>Importance of Padas in Vastu Shastra</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">According to the Vastu Shastra, a north-facing home is the most auspicious location as no pada situated in this direction is considered inauspicious. But to attract prosperity and well-being of the family members, people should follow the following tips:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">As stated above, the fifth pada is considered the most auspicious among all the nine padas because of the presence of the Lord of wealth Kuber and determines the entrance of all the flow of energy in the house. Therefore, the main gate should always be placed in the fifth pada to attract wealth and prosperity to your home.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-any-alternative-for-placing-the-main-door-at-the-fifth-pada"><strong>Is there any alternative for placing the main door at the fifth pada?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In Vastu Shastra, it is advised that if due to any circumstances like size issue or anything else, the individual cannot place the main gate at fifth pada, then they may utilize first to the fourth pada particularly, and should not leave the fifth one. In some cases, if there is no choice to place the main door from first to the fifth pada, people may use sixth to the ninth pada to place the door.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Caution: </strong>It is advised that, due to the unavailability of any other pada for placement of the door, any individual tends to place the door at the fifth pada, they are advised to leave some space from the north-east corner. The door must not touch this corner under any circumstances.<strong></strong></p>

When things are placed according to the Vastu, good vibes, energy, and health are attracted, and if not, then many unimaginable, bad things do happen. So, one must always consult Vastu before buying any property and after shifting to a new property. According to Vastu Shastra, no direction is good or bad. Still, a north-facing property is considered most auspicious due to the belief of Lord Kuber. For any doshas, in the rest of the directions, many Vastu doshas tips are also there that help to attract positive energies in non-north-facing properties too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">West-facing residences are considered unlucky due to preconceived notions. Vastu experts tell us how to take advantage of the power of west-facing homes to make them more profitable for homeowners. Home purchasers may make unusual decisions to bring prosperity and positive energy into their homes. Some people, for instance, may only desire an east-facing residence, north-facing bedrooms, or perhaps an east-facing kid&#8217;s room.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In truth, west-facing residences are less desirable due to a prevalent misunderstanding that they are unfortunate and inauspicious. According to experts of Vastu Shastra for west-facing homes, all angles are equal yet come with specific restrictions that one should be aware of for positivity to flow freely in the home.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Even if a lovely west-facing house is available, numerous real estate brokers or lucrative property advertising will try to persuade you to buy other properties. They frequently advertise such homes at a significantly higher price, claiming that they are in high demand. It is fairly unusual for people to believe and propagate rumours that a west-facing home brings bad luck and should be avoided. On the flip side, the reality is quite different than it actually is. Nevertheless, Square Yards is here to burst these misconceptions.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">According to Indian Vastu gurus, each direction has its meaning and is equally fortunate. So, ensure that the property is Vastu compliant. It will help you and your family have a happy and wealthy life ahead. Today, we will dig deep into the significance of the Vastu designs for west-facing homes. So, stay connected with us as we investigate why you should not dismiss a magnificent west-facing house just based on misconceptions and rumours. So, let&#8217;s get started.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-a-west-facing-house">What is a West-facing house?</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">A residence or apartment is termed west-facing if the main entrance faces west. Normally, west-facing residences are not considered auspicious, but Vastu experts disagree. West-facing residences&#8217; main entrances should be somewhat to the north-west or in the center. When it comes to the main door, the southwest approach should be avoided at all costs.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The 5th and 6th pada will be the finest for the main door if you split the lengths from the northwest angle to the west corner into nine equal sections or pada, with the first in one in the west and the ninth one in the southwest. The seventh, eighth, as well as ninth padas should not be used for the entry since they are regarded as the devil&#8217;s energy corner.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Nevertheless, as per Vastu Shastra, all dwellings are regarded equally auspicious. Therefore west-facing homes are no less fortunate than north or east-facing ones. If certain Vastu Shastra principles are followed, a west-facing home can be as wealthy as other dwellings. In this blog, we will look at the benefits of choosing a west-facing apartment as well as the Vastu principles to follow while building a west-facing home.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">According to the real convictions of the intellectual movement of Vastu Shastra, all dwellings, whether they are north, east, west, as well as south-facing, are regarded equally fortunate if they are built according to Vastu Shastra design concepts. According to Vastu Shastra, the orientation of the dwelling has no bearing. It all depends on where the house&#8217;s primary entrance or door is located.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-any-benefit">Is there any benefit?</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Homes with west-facing doors, however, according to Japanese house design principles, exude youth and enthusiasm. West-facing doors are said to let more energy into the dwelling. As a result, all traditional Geisha residences in Japan have their main entrance facing west. Folks who reside in west-facing residences are seen to be affluent and have a large social circle. They will have no adversaries and will be adored by everyone at work, relationships, and social contexts. Lawmakers, teachers, religious figures, and entrepreneurs benefit from living in residences with a west-facing orientation.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The kids&#8217; room in a west-facing house might be located on the south or western side, while the guest room can be located on the northwest. However, according to Vastu, the pooja room and sitting room should be at the northeast quadrant of the home, as it is the most fortunate corner.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The main bedroom should be oriented to the southwest. Your master bedroom must be on the upper floor of a multi-level home. Choose the east side for your kitchen. According to Vastu, the kitchen must not be placed immediately under or above the pooja room, bedrooms, or toilet.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The main benefit of a west-facing home is that you can enjoy the brightness and brilliance of the setting sun until dusk. Some people believe that a home facing the west will bring them more prosperity and fortune. They will have no adversaries and will be popular at work and also in social situations. Politicians, business entrepreneurs, teachers, and spiritual figures are said to prefer residences with a west-facing orientation. It is also said to be beneficial to children since it provides them with energy and happiness.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">You may have noticed that having a house that faces west or north is unattractive or brings bad omen, and so on. But much like any other property, you may employ Vastu principles to make a west-facing house fortunate. The west is not considered an unfavourable direction in Vastu Shastra. In fact, according to Vastu Shastra, any orientation is excellent for a home. However, the position of the entry or main door is the determining element in Vastu for your property.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">There is a popular misconception that west-facing dwellings are Vastu-defying, but this isn&#8217;t true. West-facing houses rank below north-and east-facing buildings in terms of auspiciousness, but they are not unlucky. In fact, Vastu principles claim that the West-facing homes offer profits and financial and non-financial advantages.</p>



<h2 id="h-vastu-tips-for-your-west-facing-house">Vastu Tips for your West-facing House</h2>



<ul><li>As per Vastu Shastra, it is critical for homeowners developing or purchasing new homes to establish a clear door situated within the appropriate &#8216;padas&#8217; or steps. The number of padas is calculated by dividing the house into nine equal sections, starting at the northwest corner, and working southward. In west-facing residences, the fourth, third, fifth, and sixth padas are the most auspicious for main entrances because they bring optimism and pleasant feelings. If the earlier in this thread padas are unavailable, the main door might be placed on padas one and two, which are neither excellent nor bad.</li><li>The kitchen is the main house engine and a source of good health and happiness for everyone who lives there. Therefore, Vastu adherents must construct their kitchens in the proper orientation. The kitchen should be in the eastern part or southeast part of the home, according to Vastu shastra. It is claimed that doing so guarantees that a kitchen&#8217;s positive charm is at its peak.</li><li>According to Vastu principles, the master bedroom should be in the house&#8217;s southern part. As a result, if the property has more than one story, the master bedroom should preferably be on the top floor. For bedrooms, there is a greater variety of direction options. As a result, they can be placed on the building&#8217;s south, west, or western most sides. It is preferable to have your master bedroom on the southwest side of the house. This orientation helps in increasing communication between couples in the room. If you have a multi-story home, the master bedroom should be on the top floor. This would bring prosperity, peace, and ancestral benefits to your household.</li><li>According to Vastu principles, private pools, storage tanks, and water submersible pumps should not be erected towards the west. Open areas should be located on the Eastern side of the building, away from the Western direction.</li><li>Colors like white, silvery, yellowish, and beige are most suited for west-facing houses, as per Vastu principles. Furthermore, it is claimed that these colours increase earnings and benefits from the Western direction. On the other hand, the home is oriented more towards the West than other directions, a lighter shade of blue can be employed to take advantage of the direction&#8217;s advantages. Off-white as well as creams are Vastu-neutral colors, making them safe choices when faced with a color palette.</li><li>Make sure your primary door entry is in the Midwest or Northwest corner of your house. Metalwork, such as a metallic name board or a metallic bell should be designed for your west-facing entrance. Maintain a detritus main entry area. Remove any trash cans or damaged furniture from the area around the entrance door.</li><li>The first and best step is to establish whether you have a property that faces west. Determining the same might be difficult because many people believe that the setting sun is in the west. The precise west direction, on the other hand, fluctuates year to year. You can establish the precise west side in only two days every year.</li><li>The temple, also known as a pooja room, is a sacred space where you may harness all of the divine forces surrounding you. The northeast direction is the most energetic zone in a west-facing home; therefore, it makes complete sense to put it in this corner. However, not every home has the necessary space to have a separate pooja room. If your lounge room does not have enough space for this, you can position your living room inside the north and a tiny temple or pooja stand inside the north part.</li><li>While verifying the directional face of the property, use a magnetic compass to trace the precise west.</li><li>Make sure the current house&#8217;s main entrance is only in the third or fourth padas.</li><li>Build the walls mainly on the south and west sides of the building- a bit thicker and taller than those on the east and north sides.</li><li>Place your living room as well as the Pooja room at the northeast corner of the house, as this is the most auspicious part of the house.</li><li>If you don&#8217;t have a pooja room, install the temple inside the living room&#8217;s north part.</li><li>Make sure the kid&#8217;s room is facing either west, south, or north-west.</li><li>If your plot is slanted, ensure that it is slanted from south to north.</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-things-you-must-avoid">Things you must avoid</h2>



<ul><li>Avoid using the setting sun to discover the precise west direction.</li><li>Except for the ones listed, avoid all other padas unless you visit a Vastu specialist beforehand.</li><li>Avoid buying land with a north-to-south slope since it may result in financial losses.</li><li>Avoid buying a parcel of land or a house with a southwest or south direction expansion.</li><li>A bore well, a storage tank or a sump should not be located in the southwest corner of a west-facing residence.</li><li>A kitchen should not be placed in the house&#8217;s southwest corner.</li><li>Sleeping beneath a beam or a wall divider is not a good idea.</li><li>Make sure your legs aren&#8217;t pointed towards the bedroom door as you sleep.</li><li>Purchase a property with a South and West border that is thinner than the East and North boundaries.</li><li>Avoid any home with the main entrance blocked by a huge item such as a tree or an electric pole.</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">As can be seen, the Vastu of west facing property is just as excellent as any other Vastu. All you have to do now is make sure you follow all of the Vastu regulations. If you are building a house on a plot, it is rather simple. However, if you are moving to a flat or apartment, you may face several difficulties. It is frequently impossible to carry out a remodel that necessitates structural changes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-justify">The kitchen is the heart of the home; therefore, it is indispensable to have a positive vibe in the kitchen and avoid all sorts of negative energies. The Vastu Shastra tips that are written in ancient times are impeccable for maintaining positivity in the kitchen. Vastu Shastra is an ancient Indian art that harnesses the energy of natural elements like the heat and light of the sun, the gravitational force of the earth, the direction of the winds, the intensity of rainfall, etc. It uses them to balance with the surroundings of mankind. There are certain rules in Vastu Shastra that are written solely to balance the kitchen interiors from the energies generated by these elements.</p>



<h2 id="h-significance-of-kitchen-vastu">Significance of Kitchen Vastu</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The kitchen is an integral part of every home. It is considered the second most sacred place in the house, after the pooja room. This is why people spend a lot of money to construct the best kitchen interiors possible, starting from flooring, cupboards, furnishing, counters, etc. But no matter how much people invest in the kitchen, it would still be useless if it is not according to the Vastu Shastra rules.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The food we cook here on our own and eat differentiates a home from a hotel or any other place. Be it a wife, a husband or a parent and a child, every one of us would have different memories associated with the kitchen. So, as long as food is an essential part of our living, the kitchen will remain an integral part of our home. Hence, Vastu Sastra has given us numerous rules that would help us radiate positive energy in the kitchen at all times.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">For a human to stay healthy and live long, eating nutritious food is a pressing priority. The outside food in restaurants and food courts is entirely unhealthy as we never know what quality of ingredients are used. Make sure that there is always a positive aura in your kitchen.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Not following the Vastu rules would result in an imbalance of energy in your kitchen, resulting in a high amount of negative energy. This negative energy affects the food made in the kitchen and, thereby, our physical and mental health.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">According to Vastu Shastra, there are 5 key elements in this universe (the Panchatatva) – namely air, water, earth, space, and fire. Having a perfect balance of all these 5 elements is what makes the kitchen fill with positive energy.</p>



<h2 id="h-location-of-the-kitchen">Location of the Kitchen</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Where the things inside the kitchen come under secondary, the location of the kitchen is the primary aspect to concentrate on. The kitchen is where we turn raw vegetables, fruits, or nuts into healthy, edible food. For such a process, the key element is fire. Another essential element is water as we use it for cleaning purposes. Balancing these 2 elements, along with the earth, sky, and the air is the key aspect on which the kitchen Vastu is decided.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">According to Vastu Shastra, the South-East direction is related to Agni, the god of fire. Lord Agni represents fire, and since fire is the main element to satisfy the kitchen&#8217;s purpose, the kitchen should be located in the South-East direction.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">While the South-East direction is always the primary choice, finding a house fulfilling this requirement is not always possible. The direction of the kitchen keeps changing depending on the facing of the house. So, in cases where the kitchen is not in the southeast direction, the northwest direction is acceptable.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Avoid the construction of the kitchen in the north, north-east, or south-west directions as it is strictly against the rules of the Vastu Shastra. Also, the inclination for the flow of water should be from the southwest towards the northeast.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-placement-of-the-fire-element">The Placement of the Fire Element</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In ancient times wooden logs were used, and over the course of time, the wooden logs were slowly replaced by LPG (Liquified Petroleum Gas) cylinders. Almost all the people in India have shifted to using cylinders like HP or Indane. There is also a further upgrade to using electricity for cooking. But no matter which among the above options it is, the food is still considered to be cooked with the energy of fire. Hence, the placement of all fire elements should be done accordingly.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The gas stove is the main source of fire, and hence it should compulsorily be placed in the southeast direction. The fire is a huge form of energy and placing the stove in the southeast direction would properly manage and handle that element. Even if it is a northwest kitchen, it should be made sure that the stove is placed in the southeast direction. Another essential point to remember is that the stove should be placed so that the person turning on the stove (i.e., lighting the fire) should always face the east, i.e., we should always be cooking while facing the east direction. The gas cylinders should also be placed in the southeast zone.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">As said above, not just stoves but all appliances, like the electric rice cooker, microwave oven, bread toaster, coffee machine, etc., would all come under things used for cooking and hence they all should also be in the right direction. Since these electrical appliances are also used for cooking, they are also a representation of fire and should be placed in the southeast direction.</p>



<h2 id="h-refrigerator-other-appliances">Refrigerator &amp; Other Appliances</h2>



<p>Electrical appliances like a mixer or wet-grinder should always be preferred to be placed in the northeast direction. But when it comes to heavy machines or utensils, like the fridge or any huge water storage, drums should be placed in the southwest direction.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">No matter where the placement is, always keep in mind that everything should be at least a foot above the floor and a foot away from the corners. Give the slightest preference to the northeast direction when it comes to keeping electrical appliances.</p>



<h2 id="h-watch-out-for-the-position-of-the-wash-basin">Watch Out for the Position of the Wash Basin</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">According to Vastu Shastra experts, water is an opposite element to fire. The fire and water always repel each other, which gives negative energy. Hence, it is important to properly balance the fire and water elements to avoid negative energies in the kitchen. And to balance this, the wash basins or sinks in the kitchen should be placed away from cooking devices. This includes that the stove, gas cylinder, microwave oven, electrical coffee maker, etc., should all not be placed parallel or near the wash basin.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The north or northeast directions in the kitchen are the best for wash basins and the water pipes connected. In many houses, the washing machine connection is also given in the kitchen. In such cases, the washing machine should also be placed in the northeast direction, but a foot away from the corners and a foot above the ground.</p>



<h2 id="h-storage">Storage</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Cupboards, shelves, etc., are all storage units where we place all the groceries, grains, rice, and many more ingredients. The placement of storage units is hence important for us to ensure that we are blessed with the groceries all along the year and that we would never run out of shortage.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">All the storage units should be in the kitchen’s southwest direction. If you have a habit of storing cooked food in the kitchen itself, then make sure that you place it in the southwest only.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Another important point to note is never store grains near the eastern or northern walls.</p>



<h2 id="h-entrance-and-ventilation">Entrance and Ventilation</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Following the Vastu shastra rules for the kitchen entrance would complete the architecture with everything in the right placements. The entrance could mostly be in either north, east or west directions. There are no specific rules about how the entrance should look, but the only point to remember is, if it is a corner entrance, then make sure to leave at least an inch gap from the wall.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Windows are also an integral part of the kitchen. Without a window, the kitchen would be suffocated due to the vapors and the smoke coming while cooking. They let in sunlight during the daytime. The windows are also the key opening through which all the negative energy generated in the kitchen gets out. So always make sure to keep the windows open while cooking.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">If there is more than one window, make sure to place them in the same direction. The exhaust fan should also be placed on the same wall as the windows, and a chimney outlet should also be in the east zone.</p>



<h2 id="h-flooring-and-wall-colors">Flooring and Wall Colors</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Vastu Shastra experts recommended that for the kitchen area the warm and neutral tone colours are the best as it gives out a calm vibe. Hence such pleasant colours should always be preferred.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The preferable paint colors for kitchen walls are pink, yellow, red, orange, or chocolate brown. There is also a scientific theory that these colors invoke hunger which is an additional plus point. Neither white nor black are preferred, and all extra-dark colors should be avoided.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The flooring could be of wooden, marble, or ceramic tiles. The cupboard work can be of any material, but make sure that the cupboard colors are also light. If you want to choose dark colors for cupboards, then make sure that they are dark and light.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-the-dining-table-be-inside-the-kitchen">Can the Dining Table be Inside the Kitchen?</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In cases where the kitchen area is huge, some people prefer placing the dining table inside the kitchen itself, instead of having a separate dining room. Vastu Shastra does not oppose the dining table in the kitchen, but care should be taken in its placement. According to the Vastu Shastra, the dining table should be placed in the northwest direction and never be in the center of the kitchen. If the northwest is occupied, then try either the north or the west direction.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Also, make sure that there is no bathroom entrance facing the dining table.</p>



<h2 id="h-some-important-points-to-remember">Some Important Points to Remember</h2>



<ul><li>The kitchen should never be located under or above the bedroom, pooja room, or bathroom.</li><li>The Vastu Shastra also states that it is unhealthy for the kitchen and a bathroom to share a common wall.</li><li>The stove or the gas cylinder should never be directly in front of the kitchen’s entrance.</li><li>Heavy things should never be placed in the east or north directions of the kitchen.</li><li>The kitchen dustbin should be under the kitchen sink, and make sure to place all wastes in the dustbin. The dustbin should also be cleared regularly.</li><li>The kitchen should be neat and clean to ensure positive energy at all times.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">You must already know about a <strong>Laughing Buddha </strong>or a <strong>Buddha statue </strong>that is commonly used in so many homes. There are several shades and layers to the question if you are seeking the <strong>Buddha meaning </strong>or planning to install a <strong>Buddha statue for home</strong>. As per Vastu Shastra guidelines, a <strong>smiling Buddha </strong>or Laughing <strong>Buddha idol</strong> is a sign of prosperity and should be there in each household. It is a symbol of much happiness and may help in infusing more positive vibes into the household. Putting a Laughing <strong>Buddha face</strong>, statue or <strong>Laughing Buddha images </strong>in the right place will go a long way towards infusing suitable cosmic energy while relieving all stress and tension in the bargain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before choosing Laughing or <strong>Peace Buddha images</strong> and choosing <strong>stone Buddha statue</strong>s among those in other materials, you should know the real story behind the legend. <em>Pu-Tai</em> or <em>Hotei</em> is called the Laughing Buddha. The image of Hotei has been made on the basis of the Chinese Zen monk who lived more than 1000 years earlier. Many saw him as a future Buddha owing to his generosity and benevolence. It was on account of his huge protruding belly and iconic smile/laugh that people started calling him as the Laughing Buddha. Getting a <strong>Laughing Buddha statue </strong>is highly auspicious for any home. You should however, keep your <strong>Lord Buddha statue</strong> in a suitable location. It is not considered lucky or auspicious to keep your <strong>marble Buddha statue </strong>or a Buddha statue in any other material outside your house. This is because Vastu Shastra principles clearly state that the living room is the best place for a <strong>Buddha statue for home décor</strong> purposes.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Keeping the Buddha Statue before the main entrance</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You may opt to keep your <strong>Laughing Buddha gift </strong>received from a loved one or bought yourself, before the main entrance of your home. Make sure that this stays at the primary entrance. You should ensure that the height is at eye level or slightly higher. You should never look at this from above. For drawing more prosperity and wealth or using what is the <strong>money Laughing Buddha</strong> effect, make sure you have the statue close towards the primary home entrance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from Laughing varieties, there are several options available including peaceful motifs, <strong>white Buddha statue</strong>s and other <strong>small Buddha statue</strong>s showcasing the idol in various moods. These include <strong>sleeping Buddha statue</strong>s and even <strong>meditation Buddha images</strong> and postures. Choose carefully.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Laughing &amp; Meditating Buddha Idol</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a peaceful and happy life, get a Laughing Buddha in a meditative state. This will help in relieving stress at home and keep this in the bedroom, prayer or worship room and the study.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Laughing Buddha with Wo Lu</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A statue of Laughing Buddha with Wo Lu is essential for safeguarding health. This statue should be present in the eastern direction of the living room or bedroom. This will enhance health of every individual in the household.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dragon Tortoise Buddha Statue</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This statue of the Laughing Buddha positioned upon a dragon tortoise indicates ample strength and power in turn. Bringing this home will help you boost your career and income levels. You can keep this behind your desk at work and it will positively impact your business or professional life.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Eastern Direction for Laughing Buddha Statues</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Vastu Shastra mandates keeping Laughing Buddha statues in the eastern direction of the home. This will help in infusing more harmony and joy into any home while nipping arguments and tension in the bud. You can also put a statue on the office or study desk for improving concentration and eliminating mental distractions while combating chances of arguments and quarrels with partners and colleagues at work.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Laughing Buddha with Gold Coins</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the best Vastu tips is getting a statue of Laughing Buddha with a sack of gold coins on the shoulder. This indicates good luck and happiness for all family members. You may also control any negative energy by putting this in the living room. A golden colored statue will naturally bring more positive vibes into any space.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Where Shouldn’t You Keep the Laughing Buddha? </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Laughing Buddha is a worshipped deity and the statue should never be there in the toilet, bathroom and kitchen. Based upon principles of Vastu Shastra, these places are not auspicious for the statue and should be strictly avoided as a result. You should never keep the statue on the floor of the house as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Vastu Shastra while construction of a house has been a part of home architecture designing or planning for years. How can we be sure about the side our house faces? It is the direction that we face while moving out of the main entrance. To ensure that your house is in the right direction according to Vastu, then you need to contact the right architect. If you are handed over the <strong>west facing house Vastu plan </strong>it indicates that your main entrance is facing towards the west direction. Before construction, ask your architect to hand over your <strong>west facing house plans for 30×40 site as per Vastu</strong>. If you are considering a <strong>west facing house Vastu plan with pooja room </strong>in the right place, here are some tips for you at the end.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>West Facing House Vastu Plan in 2021 </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Vastu Shastra is an ancient Indian science that ensures peace and prosperity within your home. If your architect hands over the <strong>west facing house Vastu plan</strong>, will you be able to identify the pros and the flaws? You can look online for help for a <strong>west facing house plans for 30×40 site as per Vastu </strong>or <strong>west facing house Vastu plan with pooja room</strong>, and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Vastu Shastra says there are five basic elements in nature &#8211; energy from air, water, fire, earth, and planets. These energies create a tremendous impact in almost every sector of life like health, relationship, thinking, peace, prosperity, education, marriage, etc. Therefore, if you have already considered a <strong>west facing house Vastu plan 30×40 </strong>slot, then know where and how to construct the rooms, main door, and various other factors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main door to your house plays the most important part in your <strong>west facing house Vastu plan</strong> and it should be facing towards the north-west. For better understanding divide the distance from north-west to south-west corners into nine equal padas or parts. Now, the 5th and 6th padas from the north-west direction is the best one for the entrance, while the 7th, 8th, and 9th padas should be completely avoided as it is the corner of negative energy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The puja and the living rooms should be on the northeast side of the house which is the most auspicious corner. The kitchen is preferred to be in the southeast corner. Remember, not to construct a kitchen directly on top or below the bedroom, puja room, and toilet. The children&#8217;s bedroom can be on the west, south, or north-west, the master bedroom in the south-west, and the guest room in the north-west direction. The dining room, overhead water tank, toilet, and study room can be in the west direction. A basement or underground room in the east or northeast direction brings a heavy flow of money. In this direction, you can also plan a swimming pool.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wall colors also play an important role in your <strong>west facing house plan as per Vastu</strong>. The ideal colors are yellow, silver, white, and beige. These are neutral tones and attract positive energy from the west. If your house extends more towards the west, then a light bluish shade is preferable to absorb more positive energies. Off-white and cream colors also go well with your <strong>west facing house plan</strong> but avoid too many bright tones. Consider constructing the west and south walls thicker and higher than the north and east walls. You can build an eastern sloping verandah but don&#8217;t constrict the northeast direction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">West-facing gardens don’t get proper sunlight in the morning, the plants need to withstand the afternoon and summer heat. Shade-loving plants cannot thrive under these conditions. So, you can look for tulips, roses, and Daffodils. These flowers are the best options for your west-facing gardens. To protect you from difficult situations plant heavy trees on the west. You need to provide sufficient space in the east direction and least in the west. This helps in removing great obstacles. On to the north-east direction, a low-level land or ditches is essential.</p>

People also search for things like sun rises in which direction in India and Manglik meaning in Kannada among other aspects. However, there is a lot of debate regarding the efficacy of an east-facing house Vastu plan.</p>
<p>Purchasing a house in India can be a daunting task. Several factors come into consideration when one is engaging in buying property and one of the most crucial of them is its compliance with Vastu Shastra.

<li><strong>Living rooms in an east-facing house should</strong> be placed in the northeast direction for bringing out the ultimate result as per Vastu norms. </li>
<li>A master bedroom should have a southwest direction for optimum Vastu compliance. </li>
<li>Ideally, guest bedrooms should be placed in the north-west direction</li>
<li>In case a student lives in this house, you should place a crystal globe in the northeast direction. </li>
<li>The south and west direction walls should be thicker and longer than the north and east direction walls. </li>
<li>Placement of the kitchens is an important aspect. The kitchen should strategically be placed in the northwest or southeast direction of the house. </li>

<li>Pyramids are a popular Vastu weapon and can easily be purchased in the market and placed in areas such as kitchens, bedrooms, living rooms, and practically anywhere as per the guidance of your Vastu consultant. This avoids discrepancies if any, in the home. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Vastu for East-Facing Main Entrance Doors</strong></p>

Ensure that it is not placed in either the southeast or northeast directions as that will hamper the harmony of the overall vibe. Tips of <strong>Vastu for east-facing main doors</strong> are mentioned here.</p>
<ol>

<li>In the case of a south-east facing entrance, you can place three Vastu pyramids, one on the top of the main door in the center and two on either side. </li>
<li>You can install a Siddha Shukra Tantra to get rid of all the negative energy in the room. </li>
<li>Use a Siddha Vastu Kalash to boost the positive energy which can be generated from the corner of the house.</li>
</ol>

<p>When designing a Vastu compliant east-facing house, make note of the following mentioned don&#8217;ts that should be avoided. To make your life easier, have a look at the list below of <strong>things to avoid in east-facing homes</strong>. </p>
<ul>
<li>No septic tanks should be placed in the northeast corner of the home. </li>
<li>Placing a kitchen in the northeast direction is a huge no. </li>
<li>Staircases if any, should not be constructed in the northeast direction. </li>
<li>Garages if any, should not be placed in the northeast direction. </li>
<li>No large trees should be planted in the north as well as the east direction. </li>

<p><strong>The Importance of Vastu Shastra for Every Room </strong></p>
<p>While there is a general belief and strategy related to Vastu Shastra, every room has its importance and can differ in terms of design and placement.

Let us take a look at the following mentioned important rooms of a home and how you can imbibe Vastu into them. </p>
<p><strong>Master Bedrooms </strong></p>
<p>Ø <strong>Master bedrooms Vastu for east-facing houses</strong> should ideally be planned in the southwest direction.</p>
<p>Ø The bed should be placed on the south or west side of the walls, ensuring that the head lies in the west or south direction and the legs are in the east or north direction. </p>
<p>Ø Changing rooms within the master bedroom should be on the north or west side of the bedroom. </p>
<p>Ø The master bathroom should not be facing the bed directly and the entrance door to the bathroom should always remain closed. </p>
<p>Ø No mirror should be placed right in front of the bed or on any surface that might allow for your reflection to show when you are on it. </p>
<p><strong>Living Rooms </strong></p>
<p>Ø Living room for Vastu east-facing houses should be in the north-east direction. This is considered auspicious. </p>
<p>Ø The walls of the living room which are on the north and east sides should be marginally thinner as well as shorter than the others. This is expected to help in bringing success in both, professional as well as personal lives. </p>
<p><strong>Pooja Rooms </strong></p>
<p>Ø Pooja room Vastu in the east-facing house is typically supposed to be in the northeast direction. As this is the most important room for religious people, no alterations should be made for its placement. </p>
<p><strong>Kitchens</strong></p>
<p>Ø Kitchens are an important part of the house and need to be placed in the southeast or northwest direction of the house. </p>
<p>While the above-mentioned rooms are the main ones, other rooms such as guest rooms, balconies, study rooms, children&#8217;s rooms, etc. also each have their own sets of rules as per Vastu Shastra and have been mentioned in the table in the segment above. Every corner of every room in an east-facing house should be adhered to and followed in accordance with Vastu Shashtra.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Prayer Room Vastu Shastra Tips For A Peaceful Home</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your prayer room must not only be a sacred space, but it should also exude positive energy that will help you relax and meditate. When the <strong>temple</strong> or <strong>prayer area</strong> is properly constructed as per <strong>Vastu Shastra</strong>, it can provide the home and its inhabitant’s health, wealth, and happiness. While every Indian household has a puja room, have you ever pondered why some give off a positive feeling as soon as you walk in, while others don&#8217;t? The answer might be because only a few individuals are familiar with <strong>Vastu</strong> concepts. To make things easier for you, we&#8217;ve compiled a list of the most significant puja room Vastu guidelines for your home. Continue reading to learn more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What is the best way to construct a temple at home, as per Vastu?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When erecting the temple, avoid placing it straight on the ground. Well, Nitien Parmar of VastuPlus suggests keeping it on a higher platform or pedestal. Either stonework or timber should be used to construct the temple. Glass or acrylic temples should be avoided. Do not overcrowd the temple. Make sure you don&#8217;t have several idols of the same Deity in the temple, whether they&#8217;re sitting or standing. “Idols or pictures put in the temple should not be broken or torn, as this is regarded as unlucky,” Parmar of VastuPlus advises.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pujas ought to be performed wherever the temple is located. The entire family usually prays together during festivities. As a result, make sure there is adequate room for the entire family to assemble and pray. The aura in the temple area should be healthy and balanced. So make it tidy and free of dust and insects, and don&#8217;t overcrowd the area with too many embellishments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What is the right direction to locate your puja room at home?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your puja room&#8217;s placement is essential in determining its auspicious ambiance. The best direction is north-east, followed by east and north. If you&#8217;re building a new house and have discretion over where your puja room is located, we highly advise you to avoid the basement or upper levels. It&#8217;s ideal if your prayer room is built on the ground level.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You must be wondering what the logic behind this is. Vastu Shastra promotes the north-east direction to maximize solar energy harvesting. Furthermore, the earth is also tilted towards the northeast direction. As a result, the northeast direction is considered auspicious since it allows the prayer area to draw all of the home&#8217;s energy towards it and then propel it forward. Not only that but it is said that Jupiter is the lord of the same direction. Consequently, this direction is referred to as <strong>Ishan Kona</strong> or Home of Jupiter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What is the ideal way to design your puja room?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ceiling in your puja room should be low. A pyramid-shaped upper surface will help to create a peaceful environment. If there is enough room, a threshold and two-door entry must be taken into consideration. According to Vastu Shastra, installing only one door is not recommended. This is due to the fact that a single, outward-opening door might get in the way of the person praying, disrupting their state of mind. If you don&#8217;t have enough space or money to construct a door, simply drape a curtain to function as a temporary doorway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the puja room is compact, the lower ceiling, along with the pyramid-shaped structure offers equilibrium and makes it easier to enter a spiritual experience. The purpose of a threshold is to keep bugs and pests out of sacred areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What is the best way to place idols in the temple?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s time to put in your idols once your puja room&#8217;s design and construction are complete. A few inches away from the wall and at least six inches from the floor would be preferable. Deceased people&#8217;s portraits and artworks showing violence have no place in your puja room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To maintain consistent air movement around the idol, it should be placed away from the wall. This also helps to surround the deity with the scent of the incense sticks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How should I store things in the puja room?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Are you unsure about where to put all of your religious literature, candles, and puja items? Storage must always face south-east. Why you may ask? Storage should face south-east to ensure that sunlight is not obstructed. Additionally, there should be no storage above the deity. All storage must be placed under the idols. Disrespect is shown by storing items above idols. It also has an impact on the free movement of energy and light. This is not only helpful in terms of Vastu, but it is also practical because items placed at ground level are easily accessible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What should be the colour of the puja room?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The colour of the prayer room should be according to the Vastu guidelines. Vastu Shastra recommends subdued colours for maintaining the serenity of a puja area. Whites, soft blues, and pastel yellow are all appropriate colours. In a puja room, gloomy colours should be avoided since these will not create a peaceful atmosphere in a place of worship and can be distracting instead. The majority of temple units in Indian houses, however, are constructed of dark wood. This is a Vastu Dosha that prevents divinity from entering your household. If you already have a dark-colored puja unit that you don&#8217;t want to replace, consider painting the wall behind it with a bright colour. To counteract the gloomy colour, the bright colour offers enough illumination to the unit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Likewise, for the flooring of your puja area, choose white marble or any light-colored marble tiling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What should be the lighting of the puja room?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What&#8217;s not to like about a space that&#8217;s bright? And, more importantly, a bright puja room? As it will be the smallest room in your house, it will require bright lighting. With a window facing northeast, light up your prayer area with Diyas. If this isn&#8217;t possible, make do with plenty of artificial lighting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not only will your puja room be bright, but you&#8217;ll also have enough air and be able to sit comfortably while praying for lengthy periods of time if you have a north-east facing window.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Have a Small Apartment? Here are some tips for the ideal prayer room.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People in today&#8217;s world of nuclear families and small flats don&#8217;t have the luxury of devoting an entire room to praying. The trend for compact fully prepared puja mandaps that can be mounted on walls and hallways has increased as a result.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Living Room</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The greatest spot to install a puja unit in a small flat is in the living room. If you have empty shelves in your entertainment unit, you may create a separate puja room by decorating a tiny section. For those who spend long hours in meditation and prayer, however, solitude and focus will continue to be a problem.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kitchen</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A kitchen cabinet may be customized to function as a miniature temple. It is advised to make the cabinet door have chiseled edges and shapely openings on its surface so that smoke can be properly dispersed when diyas and fragrance sticks are lighted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Corners</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Placing up a series of elegant pedestals so that the idols are a few inches above the ground level may quickly transform an empty corner of the dining room into a puja space. Small lights can be placed above the idols to brighten the prayer area. If you need seclusion, hang a little curtain beneath the top shelf to keep the idols hidden from view.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cupboards</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Why not construct a closet for the deities with sophisticated customizable doors and shelves while constructing a cupboard for everyday use goods at home? This can be the ultimate space-saving puja area for a tiny flat. For further decoration, you can add brass fittings on the cabinet sides and broad shelves with roomy drawers at the bottom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Designing a temple at home: what to do and what not to do</strong></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>To maintain the sacredness of the holy place, the puja room should always be separated by doors. As per Vastu, a puja space without a door is inauspicious. This is because the pious spirits inside a puja room might wane if there isn&#8217;t a door.</li>
<li>A Diya, lamp, or anything else you light in the puja space as per religion must be lit on the right-hand side of the person offering prayers.</li>
<li>Maintain a clutter-free and spotless puja space.</li>
<li>Ensure that an electric switchboard is located near the temple so that the area may be lit up during festive occasions.</li>
<li>When worshiping in the puja room, idols and pictures of God must never face each other; deities facing north or east are regarded as auspicious.</li>
<li>The shrine should be built high enough for the statues&#8217; feet to be at the level of the chest of the person who is worshiping. Never put the god statue down on the ground.</li>
<li>A temple or puja area cannot be built against a wall with a bathroom behind it. The justification for not placing the sacred space next to the restroom is to prevent bad energy from entering the house.</li>
<li>Bold or dark hues, such as black, gray, or any other gloomy hue, should never be used in the prayer area.</li>
<li>Avoid putting trash cans in the puja area since this raises the chances of bad energy flowing through the atmosphere.</li>
<li>Remove any wilted flowers from the puja space. As soon as the flowers and foliage lose their freshness, remove them from this area.</li>
<li>It is deemed inauspicious to place the puja area under a stairway or against the toilet wall. It is considered a big Vastu dosha.</li>
<li>When storing water, make use of copper vessels rather than glass or low-cost metals such as aluminium.</li>
<li>To get the greatest benefits, place the puja ghar on the bottom level of your house. According to Vastu, mandirs should not be built in basements or on upper levels.</li>
<li>According to Vastu Shastra, you should not have a temple in your bedroom. If you absolutely have to place it in the bedroom, make sure your feet aren&#8217;t facing the temple.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FAQs</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Where in the house should the puja area be located?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Building a puja room should be done in the northeast, east, or north orientations. These directions are said to be the luckiest. To guarantee that the puja rooms are free of bad energy, keep them away from the stairwells and restrooms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Which sort of mandir is suitable for use at home?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A mandir built of wood, as per Vastu Shastra, is auspicious and regarded more holy. Apart from other wood kinds, Sheesham Wood (Rosewood) is deemed blessed for temples.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Which metal is considered propitious for puja?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is recommended to utilize objects made of clay, silver, copper, or gold in a puja. Favorable energies are easily received by these things. Owing to the high cost of silver and gold, it may be more cost-effective to use copper, brass, or stone items.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Which items should be avoided in the puja room?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leather is regarded as an impure material to keep in the mandir. The temple space must not contain any animal skin. Also, don&#8217;t store cash in the puja room. While it is not deemed unclean, saving/storing money at a place where you seek serenity and prosperity is not deemed appropriate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What Colour scheme should you choose in your puja room? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Choose pastel colours such as white, blue and yellow. These emit a sense of calm and tranquilly that is conducive to prayer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vastu is the Indian equivalent of Feng Shui and is a complete guide to getting the best energy out of any house including properties and workplaces. Vastu is an important aspect when it comes to any real estate and today many developers are aware of it and work according to its principles.</p>
<p>The starting point is the main door of any property which brings energy into the house. The front door is expected to bring good luck, good fortune, and positivity into the house. Certain directions for the main door are good according to Vastu and some directions can lead to Vastu defects. So, we are with some Vastu tips for the main door</p>
<p>The main objective of Vastu shastra is to integrate architecture with nature.</p>
<p><strong>The direction of the Main door</strong></p>
<p>Vastu principles suggest the north, east, northeast, and west are the most favorable directions for the front door. Vastu does not recommend having the main door in the south, southeastern, and northwestern directions. But Vastu has a cure of conditions that cannot be changed and there are ways to compensate for the undesirable directions. One way is to get the front door made in different combinations of wood and metal.</p>
<p>Vastu shastra recommends setting up different combinations of pyramids and helixes of different inauspicious directions that some front doors open to. Directions of doors in the southwest or southern directions can be compensated by using a lead helix and a lead metal pyramidal combination. An undesirable northwest direction of the main door is recommended for correction by getting the pyramid and helix made of brass. Vastu experts and practitioners recommend the use of a helix made of copper to correct a Vastu defect made led by the door in the southeast direction.</p>
<p><strong>The best material according to Vastu for the main door</strong></p>
<p>Among materials used for the main door, the most auspicious one is wood. But if there are Vastu defects of direction, various types of metal combined with wood shall be required for specific direction. For the defect of the south direction, a combination of wood and metal is recommended. Metalwork on the main door is advised if it faces the west. For the favourable directions of east and north, there are some special guidelines. North facing doors can have silver colour doors but for the east, minimal metal on a primarily wooden door works according to Vastu.</p>
<p><strong>Main door and its visibility as per Vastu</strong></p>
<p>The main door of any building, house, or establishment is required to be the biggest, ornate and conspicuous. The Main Door is required to open in the clockwise direction and it should be at least 7 feet in height and three feet in width. Vastu shastra recommends that the other doors in the house should be shorter than the height of the main door.</p>
<p><strong>Vastu and its origins</strong></p>
<p>The actual name of Vastu shastra is Vastu Shilpa Shastra and it is found in a section of the Atharva Ved which is the Stapatya Ved. It makes Vastu Shashtra, a science that is thousands of years old. The prime essence of Vastu Shastra is the effect of sun rays falling on different areas of a building. Vastu shastra was a purely technical subject and was practiced by ancient architects and designers. Evidence of Vastu shastra has been found in the ancient excavated cities of Harappa and Mohenjo Daro. There is a mention of Vastu shastra in the Mahabharat as well as in the Ramayana.</p>
<p>There is an interesting legend about Lord Shiva overpowering a demon named Andhak after many years of battle. A spirit arose from the perspiration of the Lord and consumed the blood of the demon. The spirit went on to do penance and earned the gratitude of Lord Shiva who offered the spirit a boon. Armed with the boon, the spirit went on to wreak havoc until it was overpowered by 81 Gods led by lord Brahma who had the now repentant spirit face down. Lord Brahma placed a conditional boon to the spirit, saying that those who pray to the spirit as a Vastudevta after building a structure would be blessed and that the spirit was free to torment and trouble those who did not worship it.</p>
<p>This legend led to the development of Vastu Shastra which has been around since 6000B.C. or even before it. In the early days, Vastu shastra was used mainly in the construction of temples and royal palaces. There is mention of Vastu shastra in the Matsya Puran. The names of the early practitioners of Vastu Shastra reads like a mythological who’s who: Vishwakarma, Narad, Nagnajit, Purandra, Brahma, Bhrigu, Purandara, Nandisa, Adri, Vasista, Sukra, and Brihaspati. The first known books on Vastu Shastra were the Kasyapa Silpa and Agama Shastra. The sanctity of Vastu Shastra was such that the ancient architects who were known as sthapatis considered buildings and dwellings as living beings.</p>
<p><strong>The Science of Vastu Shastra</strong></p>
<p>It is interesting to know that every building has a horoscope of its own. There are ayadi calculations that attempt to match the horoscope of a building with that of the inhabitants of a house. The horoscope of a building is known as the ayadi shadvarga.</p>
<p>An important part of Vastu Shastra is known as aya Prakaran where aya denotes income. Aya prakaran needs to be taken up and followed whenever any land is taken up for construction. This will bring good luck and benefits. Some vastu experts can calculate and follow the formulae of Arya and varga. There are nine different vargas.</p>
<p>8 ayas denote different directions. The Dhwaja aya denotes the east and brings benefits of money. The Dhumra aya of the southeast brings sorrow. The Simha aya of the south denotes luxury. The Svana aya of the southwest has effects of great sins. The gaja aya for the north brings career prospects. The kaka aya of the northeast brings in death.</p>
<p>Ayas have their hierarchies and are said to have masculine features.</p>
<p>The Vargas also have different effects. The Swavarga brings monetary benefits, the second is with fewer benefits, the third is auspicious, the fourth has the effect of diseases, the fifth causes enemies, the sixth quarrels/disputes, the seventh with some other benefits and the eighth is the most dangerous with the effects of death.</p>
<p><strong>Decorating the area around the front door</strong></p>
<p>The most important aspect for attracting positive energy through the main door is to keep the area around it clean. There should never be a mirror that reflects this door as it will cause the incoming positive energy to bounce back. Also, the main door area needs to be well illuminated. Other Vastu tips include having an attractive nameplate with the house number prominently featured on the door.</p>
<p>Door colour is an important and attractive feature of the main door. Doors should be painted brown, red, pink, and orange if they are facing east. Green and metallic paints are good for main doors facing north. Vastu experts recommend white and light blue for doors facing northeast and southwest direction. Stairs leading to the main door should be of wood or stone and the number of steps should be even.</p>
<p><strong>Vastu do’s and don’ts for the main door</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do’s</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Put some good decoration near the main door- The best ones are potted plants.</li>
<li>Put a nameplate on the front door. If the main door faces the north, use a wooden nameplate.</li>
<li>Ensure the door opens clockwise and the hinges are well oiled to avoid squeaking.</li>
<li>Ensure the main door opens to 90 degrees without any obstruction</li>
<li>Place idols and pictures of Gods and goddesses near the main door.</li>
<li>Have a foyer or narrow passage from the main door that leads into a wider passage<strong>. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>  </strong><strong>Don’ts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Paint the main door black</li>
<li>Let the main door face the main door of another house. This will disrupt energy.</li>
<li>Place shoes or shoe racks near the main door.</li>
<li>Let the main door stand in a corner.</li>
<li>Let septic tanks be near the main door.</li>
<li>Let the shadow of any building nearby fall on the main door</li>
<li>Keep trash cans or garbage near the main entrance.</li>
<li>Let the main door face a dilapidated old house that is not occupied</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What to avoid at the main entrance of the house</strong></p>
<p>As per Vastu Shastra, the things to avoid at the main entrance of the house are septic tanks, broken furniture, shoes, and shoe racks, sliding or circular opening, temples, and mirrors. The main door should not be at the center of the wall in which it is housed but towards one of the edges. The main entrance should not be in front of intersecting roads.</p>
<p><strong>Best positions for placing the main door</strong></p>
<p>The main door should be facing north or east for best results. There are ways to compensate for the Vastu defect caused by the main door facing west and south. If the positioning is inevitable and cannot be changed, there are combinations of pyramids and helixes of different compositions to compensate for the undesirable placements.</p>
<p>The main door should be positioned towards one of the edges of the wall in which it is placed. If the house is multi-storeyed, the main door on each floor should not be vertically on top and not in the same vertical line.</p>
<p>The level of the main door is required to be above ground level and it should not face a wall.</p>
<p><strong>Simple ways to align with Vastu while renovating your house</strong></p>
<p>Care is to be taken during renovation while painting the main door in colours suited to Vastu. During the renovation, ensure that the main door is not converted into a sliding door or any kind of arched or semi-circular structure.</p>
<p>Home renovation is a good opportunity to rectify the identified Vastu defects. If a major renovation is being done, the colour, material, decorations around the main door can be rectified. It would be a good idea to consult a Vastu expert for the best advice before the start of renovation so that the best corrections are possible.</p>
<p>Home renovation should not disrupt the Vastu alignment already in the house. A Vastu expert will give guidance to not only make corrections but also to improve Vastu alignment during the renovation process.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>   <strong>Which direction should the entrance of my kitchen face?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The kitchen should face the east and if not east then the next most auspicious direction is north or west. The kitchen should be in the northwest corner.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>   <strong>Can I have sliding doors in my main entrance?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>No. Sliding doors are an absolute negation for Vastu. Have a normal manually opening door and do not use automatic door closers.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>   <strong>Which is the best-recommended place for keeping shoes or shoe racks in the house?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Many houses have shoe racks near the entrance or the main door and this is not recommended in a place from where prosperity is supposed to enter the house. The direction in which shoes are shoe racks is supposed to be kept in the south and southwest direction. If there is no option to keep a shoe rack in any other place other than the main entrance, keep the shoe rack outside the door.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>   <strong>Is it alright to have my front gate at right angles to the main entrance of my house?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Vastu recommends that the main gate and the main door should both face the same direction. If you have more than one entrance door, select the door facing the gate and make this door the main entrance.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>   <strong>Can I use a metal door with a wooden casing for my main entrance door?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Vastu shastra recommends a full wooden door with only minimal metal if it is facing the east<strong>. </strong>If you still wish to use a metal-reinforced door, the main entrance should face the west.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap"><em><em>Vibes inside your home affect you in unimaginable ways. We have got you some simple <a href="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/vastu-tips-for-wealth-and-happiness"><strong>Vastu tips</strong></a> to help you battle the negativity and preserve sanity inside your home during the testing times of the COVID-19 pandemic.</em></em></p>



<p>We all have been battling an unprecedented health crisis on our own for the past 10 months now. Life has been restricted inside the four walls of our home; all those Saturday get-together plans, travel vacations have taken a backseat. Our social life has somewhat gone down to zero, taking a toll on our mental health. In these times of negative energies floating around, while we try to cheer ourselves up, we could also seek solace in our ancient Indian Science of Vastu. Here are some Vastu tips for COVID-19 that can help you regain your sanity in these insane times. </p>



<h2><strong>De-clutter Your Space</strong></h2>



<p>One of the most important Vastu Tips for<strong> <a href="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/covid-19-may-prod-people-to-buy-new-homes-heres-why">COVID-19 pandemic</a></strong> is to de-clutter your home. Take out the old stuff and make space for new as it generates positive energy which in turn refreshes your mind and attracts positive vibes.</p>



<h2>Vastu Tips: Don&#8217;t Underestimate <strong>the Magical Camphor</strong></h2>



<p>Ever thought of the benefits of burning camphor in the house. This humble solid with a strong aroma is not utilised to its true potential. Camphor has therapeutic properties. You can choose to burn camphor at various corners of your <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/step-inside-mirzapur-actor-ali-faizals-bandra-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">home</a>. This will neutralise negative energies and create a nice and auspicious environment inside.</p>



<h2>Vastu Tips for COVID-19: Light Lamps, Diyas and Incense Sticks</h2>



<p>A well-lit home not just pushes away negativity but also amplifies the beautiful interiors. You must always make it a habit to light diyas, lamps, and incense sticks every morning and evening. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="360" height="260" src="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutterstock_1848062101.jpg" alt="Ward off COVID negativity by lighting diyas" class="wp-image-24396" srcset="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutterstock_1848062101.jpg 360w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutterstock_1848062101-300x217.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /></figure></div>



<h2>Medicines in the Kitchen? A Big No.</h2>



<p>Do you have the habit of keeping medicines in the kitchen? You should get rid of that. The kitchen is the last place to keep medicines as the kitchen represents happiness and cheer whereas medicines represent the opposite. So, as Vastu tells us kitchen and medicines don&#8217;t blend well.</p>



<h2>Meditation is What You Need</h2>



<p>Before you cleanse your surroundings and chuck out the COVID negativity from <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.squareyards.com/gurgaon-real-estate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your home</a>, it is important to perform a mind cleansing activity. This is what meditation is for you. So, start with 15 minutes a day and you will surely become a better person than today.</p>



<h2>Say Hello to Wind Chimes</h2>



<p>Hang wind chimes at the window side or anywhere it&#8217;s airy. The tinkling of these bells will break the pattern of all kinds of negative energy, making space for positive energy to absorb inside.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="360" height="260" src="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutterstock_648230533.jpg" alt="Significance of WInd Chimes in Vastu" class="wp-image-24397" srcset="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutterstock_648230533.jpg 360w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutterstock_648230533-300x217.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /></figure></div>



<p>There is still a lot of time for things to get back to normal. What can we do till then? We can definitely try to keep ourselves strong and shield ourselves with positive thoughts to ward off the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/future-of-home-design-in-the-post-covid-era" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID </a>negativity and inspire others to practice the same. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-75.png" alt="Vastu Tips for Wealth and Happiness" class="wp-image-20335" width="387" height="267"/></figure></div>



<p>We need to be aware of the various&nbsp;Vastu tips for wealth and happiness&nbsp;since one of the key elements of well-being is financial prosperity. And what better way to start than at home? Rearranging your home or decorating a new one, according to Vastu, has a lot of benefits, the results of which has been experienced by many. Vastu or Vastu Shastra is an age-old Indian system and method of architecture. It defines the various laws of laying out of and arranging of a place so that it is alignment with the different forces of nature and brings about an all-over positive effect.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Let’s take a look at some of the Vastu tips for wealth and happiness that might work out well for your home:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>Well, when it comes to the north zone of the house, to attract wealth, you can always go with a potted money plant. If you do not want to keep a money plant, then you can instead keep or hang a picture of a forest or lush green fields, since it is a signifier of ushering in better career growth opportunities and as a result, more financial prosperity.&nbsp;</li><li>You need to pay attention to the entrance of the house. It should be arranged beautifully and well-kept at all times so that it brings out a feeling of positivity. It acts as a marker of beautiful and prosperous things surrounding you. An un-kept entrance, however, marks the fact that you will be surrounded by trouble and unpleasant things. Hence, taking particular care of the entrance of the house according to&nbsp;Vastu tips for wealth and happiness&nbsp;is of immense necessity.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Realize the Importance of Directions in Vastu:</strong></p>



<ul><li>You need to pay particular attention to the north-east corner of your house. That is the direction of Lord Kuber, who is the God of wealth in the Indian pantheon. It is important to have this corner and part of your house free of any form of clutter to let the positive energy flow in from this direction. If you want you can also place a mirror in the northeast corner, to attract economic prosperity. </li><li>We all have safes and lockers in our houses, right? So, according to Vastu tips for wealth, you should make sure that these items, and all valuable items, are kept in the south-west corner of the house. However, take note of the direction of the door of the locker or the safe. Does it open in the south or west corner? Then, it might incur a lot of expense. The doors should be facing the north-east direction. </li><li>The focus, as you can see when it comes to Vastu tips for wealth and happiness is always on the north-east corner of the house. To welcome wealth into your household, you might also want to place water objects in the north-east corner. For example, you can keep an aquarium or if you have space, install a small water fountain. This helps with the flow of positive energy which in turn brings wealth. </li><li>The fact that water is one of our most treasured wealth is reiterated by the Vastu Shastra. It says that the moment you see that there is water leakage or damage of sorts, you should immediately get it repaired since it might be a sign for wealth leaking away!</li><li>When you are building a new home, make it a point, the toilet is not in the southwest corner. It might lead to heavy financial loss and even disturbed sleep. </li><li>Keep the clocks ticking! Yes, that’s right. A clock in the house which does not work signifies a stagnation in your financial growth and hence according to Vastu tips for wealth and happiness, you need to make sure that all the clocks in your house are up and working. </li></ul>

<p>Internal staircase Vastu principles lay down several core tenets of integrating them within homes with multiple stories. Adhering to the same will usher in greater prosperity for members of any home.</p>



<p>Wondering about internal staircase Vastu principles and why they are important? The ancient Vastu Shastra guidelines lay equal emphasis on each and every component of the home, laying down basic dos and don’ts in order to optimize well-being, happiness, prosperity and good health. Staircases are a pivotal part of any independent home, apartment building or commercial establishment. In case they are not suitably placed, it may lead to an accumulation of negative energy which may wash away all the accumulated positive vibes of the space.</p>



<p><strong>Direction and other tenets as per internal staircase Vastu principles</strong></p>



<p>Internal staircase <a href="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/money-plant-vastu">Vastu guidelines</a> clearly state that all such structures should be constructed in a manner where the person climbing the steps moves to the southward direction from the north. The movement can also be from east to west. Any other type of movement will bring negative energy. This applies for both external and internal staircases across both residential and commercial properties. Staircases are perceived as spaces with abundant energy flow and hence this should go clockwise as someone uses them. </p>



<p>Vastu for internal staircases states that the number of steps should be in an odd number, i.e. 15, 19, 17 and so on. This is because a majority of individuals are right-handed and put the right foot forward while climbing. While finishing up, they end with the right foot as well. It is only possible when there are an odd number of steps on the staircase. Putting the right foot forward is equated with greater gains while the left one is equated with losses.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-82.png" alt="staircase vastu

" class="wp-image-20380" width="284" height="190"/></figure></div>



<p><strong>Internal staircase Vastu tips that you can use</strong></p>



<p>When it comes to some handy internal staircase Vastu tips, you should know that the height difference should be optimal between the steps. The walls adjoining the structure must have colorful pots, flowers or even wallpaper. Colorful décor will naturally usher in more positive energy between floors. You should refrain from constructing any staircase in the north-eastern corner of any structure irrespective of whether it is external or internal. Other rooms such as Pooja rooms or bathrooms must not be slotted under the staircase. You may use the space for storage purposes however.</p>



<p>Avoid putting the staircase right in front of the home entrance since this creates a sense of imbalance overall. This can be combated by putting indoor plants on the staircase. Build your staircase in the southern or western portion of the dwelling. Make sure that the number of steps does not end with zero. Spiral staircases may be harbingers of poor health and those encircling whole buildings are also avoidable. Rooms with staircases in south-west portions of basements are not advisable and doors should be there at both the end and beginning of the structure. Stairs must not touch eastern or northern walls. Repair broken steps swiftly without delays.</p>
