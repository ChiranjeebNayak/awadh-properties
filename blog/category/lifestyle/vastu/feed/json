            "content_html": "\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The very concept of Vastu Shastra came forward during the Vedic times in India, that is the science of space and architecture that guides the people to create spaces and environment that supports their physical, mental and spiritual health and paves the way for a prosperous life. Vastu Shastra is regarded as the science of designing and building houses, offices, temples, and other living spaces. Since ancient times, energy has been considered a free-flowing creation that can neither be created nor destroyed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">&nbsp;The transformation from one form to the other is possible. This free-flowing energy directs all the positive or negative vibes and thoughts within ourselves and our surroundings. Following the sets of rules and regulations of Vastu before entering any new place is mandatory to live a healthy and peaceful life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Referring to our auspicious Mythology and Vedas, Vastu Shastra indicates the directions- East and North to be most blessed with positive energies; hence, North-facing homes are the most auspicious ones.<strong> Vastu Shastra for North Facing Homes </strong>is widely accepted because of the presence of Lord Kuber, also known as the God of Wealth, in the North direction. It is not only the north-facing home that brings in prosperity but the whole North-facing house planin which every direction should be planned as per the Vastu. North Facing Home Vastu includes a complete list of directions for different corners of the house that needs to be followed to attract good positive energies. The list is as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Master Bedroom:</strong> Should face South-west region</li><li><strong>Pooja Room:</strong> Should be located in North-east region</li><li><strong>Living Room:</strong> Should face North-east region</li><li><strong>Guest Room:</strong> Should be in the North-west region</li><li><strong>Kitchen:</strong> Should lie in the South-east or North-west direction.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-about-north-facing-home\"><strong>About North Facing Home</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Briefly describing since the existence of humans, directions have played an essential role in assisting where, what and when to hunt, hide and migrate. Era&#8217;s changed, but directions still play a significant role in defining wealth and prosperity in human life; hence, the main entry gate of any house situated in the north direction is considered as North Facing Home that accounts for most positive energies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-are-north-facing-homes-good-or-bad\"><strong>Are North Facing Homes Good or Bad?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">It would not be fitting to conclude that only <strong>North Facing House Plans</strong> are the most appropriate and good ones, and the rest of the directions are not; rather, all the directions have their specialty, no direction is good or bad. People need to follow specific guidelines of <strong>Vastu Shastra for North Facing Homes </strong>to attract prosperity to their homes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-location-of-main-gate-in-north-facing-house-plan\"><strong>Location of Main Gate in North Facing House Plan</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">In any house plan, there is always a special emphasis on the location of the main gate because it is the entrance point of the home from where either all negative or all the positive forces will enter the home. Hence its placement is the major area of concern. So, in a<strong> North Facing House Plan</strong>, the main gate should only be located in the North direction, the distance between north-east and north-west is divided into nine equal parts, where also the fifth step is the most auspicious among all because of the belief of the existence of God of Wealth there.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><span style=\"background-color:#0693e3\" class=\"has-inline-background\">9</span></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><span style=\"background-color:#0693e3\" class=\"has-inline-background\">8</span></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><span style=\"background-color:#0693e3\" class=\"has-inline-background\">7</span></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><span style=\"background-color:#0693e3\" class=\"has-inline-background\">6</span></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><span style=\"background-color:#0bf90d\" class=\"has-inline-background\">5</span></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><span style=\"background-color:#fef208\" class=\"has-inline-background\">4</span></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><span style=\"background-color:#fef208\" class=\"has-inline-background\">3</span></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><span style=\"background-color:#fef208\" class=\"has-inline-background\">2</span></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\" data-align=\"center\"><span style=\"background-color:#fef208\" class=\"has-inline-background\">1</span></td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>\u2191 Towards North</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-importance-of-padas-in-vastu-shastra\"><strong>Importance of Padas in Vastu Shastra</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">According to the Vastu Shastra, a north-facing home is the most auspicious location as no pada situated in this direction is considered inauspicious. But to attract prosperity and well-being of the family members, people should follow the following tips:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">As stated above, the fifth pada is considered the most auspicious among all the nine padas because of the presence of the Lord of wealth Kuber and determines the entrance of all the flow of energy in the house. Therefore, the main gate should always be placed in the fifth pada to attract wealth and prosperity to your home.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-is-there-any-alternative-for-placing-the-main-door-at-the-fifth-pada\"><strong>Is there any alternative for placing the main door at the fifth pada?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">In Vastu Shastra, it is advised that if due to any circumstances like size issue or anything else, the individual cannot place the main gate at fifth pada, then they may utilize first to the fourth pada particularly, and should not leave the fifth one. In some cases, if there is no choice to place the main door from first to the fifth pada, people may use sixth to the ninth pada to place the door.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Caution: </strong>It is advised that, due to the unavailability of any other pada for placement of the door, any individual tends to place the door at the fifth pada, they are advised to leave some space from the north-east corner. The door must not touch this corner under any circumstances.<strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-ideal-north-facing-house-plan\"><strong>Ideal North Facing House Plan</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-west-direction\"><strong>West Direction</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><u><strong>Ideal for:</strong></u></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Kids Bedroom</li><li>Dining Room</li><li>Study Room</li><li>Stairs</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-north-west-direction\"><strong>North-West Direction</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Ideal for:</u></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Guest Bedroom</li><li>Kitchen</li><li>Living Room</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-north-direction\"><strong>North Direction</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Ideal for:</u></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Drawing Room</li><li>Living Room</li><li>Office</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-north-east-direction\"><strong>North-East Direction</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Ideal for:</u></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Puja Room</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Not Good for:</u></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Guardroom, storeroom, servant\u2019s room, generator, kitchen, bathroom, and stairs.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-east-direction\"><strong>East Direction</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Ideal for:</u></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Hall</li><li>Balcony</li><li>Porch</li><li>Verandah</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-south-east-direction\"><strong>South-East Direction</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Ideal for:</u></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Bathroom</li><li>Kitchen</li><li>Stairs</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-south-direction\"><strong>South Direction</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Ideal for:</u></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Stairs</li><li>Overhead Tank</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-south-west-direction\"><strong>South-West Direction</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Ideal for:</u></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Master Bedroom</li><li>Garage</li><li>Dresser</li><li>Walk-in closet</li><li>Stairs</li><li>Bathroom</li><li>Store</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-placement-tips-for-north-facing-home-vastu\"><strong>Placement Tips for North Facing Home Vastu</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-slope-in-a-north-facing-home\"><strong>Slope in a North Facing Home</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Since our ancient legends North direction has been considered highly auspicious as it attracts health and prosperity, therefore, it is advised that no north-facing house should have a slope existing in the North to south direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-kitchen\"><strong>Kitchen</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">In a <strong>North-facing house plan, </strong>it is advised that the Kitchen should be located either in the southeast or northwest corners.

            "content_text": "The very concept of Vastu Shastra came forward during the Vedic times in India, that is the science of space and architecture that guides the people to create spaces and environment that supports their physical, mental and spiritual health and paves the way for a prosperous life. Vastu Shastra is regarded as the science of designing and building houses, offices, temples, and other living spaces. Since ancient times, energy has been considered a free-flowing creation that can neither be created nor destroyed.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;The transformation from one form to the other is possible. This free-flowing energy directs all the positive or negative vibes and thoughts within ourselves and our surroundings. Following the sets of rules and regulations of Vastu before entering any new place is mandatory to live a healthy and peaceful life.\n\n\n\nReferring to our auspicious Mythology and Vedas, Vastu Shastra indicates the directions- East and North to be most blessed with positive energies; hence, North-facing homes are the most auspicious ones. Vastu Shastra for North Facing Homes is widely accepted because of the presence of Lord Kuber, also known as the God of Wealth, in the North direction. It is not only the north-facing home that brings in prosperity but the whole North-facing house planin which every direction should be planned as per the Vastu. North Facing Home Vastu includes a complete list of directions for different corners of the house that needs to be followed to attract good positive energies. The list is as follows:\n\n\n\nMaster Bedroom: Should face South-west regionPooja Room: Should be located in North-east regionLiving Room: Should face North-east regionGuest Room: Should be in the North-west regionKitchen: Should lie in the South-east or North-west direction.\n\n\n\nAbout North Facing Home\n\n\n\nBriefly describing since the existence of humans, directions have played an essential role in assisting where, what and when to hunt, hide and migrate. Era&#8217;s changed, but directions still play a significant role in defining wealth and prosperity in human life; hence, the main entry gate of any house situated in the north direction is considered as North Facing Home that accounts for most positive energies.\n\n\n\nAre North Facing Homes Good or Bad?\n\n\n\nIt would not be fitting to conclude that only North Facing House Plans are the most appropriate and good ones, and the rest of the directions are not; rather, all the directions have their specialty, no direction is good or bad. People need to follow specific guidelines of Vastu Shastra for North Facing Homes to attract prosperity to their homes.\n\n\n\nLocation of Main Gate in North Facing House Plan\n\n\n\nIn any house plan, there is always a special emphasis on the location of the main gate because it is the entrance point of the home from where either all negative or all the positive forces will enter the home. Hence its placement is the major area of concern. So, in a North Facing House Plan, the main gate should only be located in the North direction, the distance between north-east and north-west is divided into nine equal parts, where also the fifth step is the most auspicious among all because of the belief of the existence of God of Wealth there.\n\n\n\n987654321\u2191 Towards North\n\n\n\nImportance of Padas in Vastu Shastra\n\n\n\nAccording to the Vastu Shastra, a north-facing home is the most auspicious location as no pada situated in this direction is considered inauspicious. But to attract prosperity and well-being of the family members, people should follow the following tips:\n\n\n\nAs stated above, the fifth pada is considered the most auspicious among all the nine padas because of the presence of the Lord of wealth Kuber and determines the entrance of all the flow of energy in the house. Therefore, the main gate should always be placed in the fifth pada to attract wealth and prosperity to your home.\n\n\n\nIs there any alternative for placing the main door at the fifth pada?\n\n\n\nIn Vastu Shastra, it is advised that if due to any circumstances like size issue or anything else, the individual cannot place the main gate at fifth pada, then they may utilize first to the fourth pada particularly, and should not leave the fifth one. In some cases, if there is no choice to place the main door from first to the fifth pada, people may use sixth to the ninth pada to place the door.\n\n\n\nCaution: It is advised that, due to the unavailability of any other pada for placement of the door, any individual tends to place the door at the fifth pada, they are advised to leave some space from the north-east corner. The door must not touch this corner under any circumstances.\n\n\n\nIdeal North Facing House Plan\n\n\n\nWest Direction\n\n\n\nIdeal for:\n\n\n\nKids BedroomDining RoomStudy RoomStairs\n\n\n\nNorth-West Direction\n\n\n\nIdeal for:\n\n\n\nGuest BedroomKitchenLiving Room\n\n\n\nNorth Direction\n\n\n\nIdeal for:\n\n\n\nDrawing RoomLiving RoomOffice\n\n\n\nNorth-East Direction\n\n\n\nIdeal for:\n\n\n\nPuja Room\n\n\n\nNot Good for:\n\n\n\nGuardroom, storeroom, servant\u2019s room, generator, kitchen, bathroom, and stairs.\n\n\n\nEast Direction\n\n\n\nIdeal for:\n\n\n\nHallBalconyPorchVerandah\n\n\n\nSouth-East Direction\n\n\n\nIdeal for:\n\n\n\nBathroomKitchenStairs\n\n\n\nSouth Direction\n\n\n\nIdeal for:\n\n\n\nStairsOverhead Tank\n\n\n\nSouth-West Direction\n\n\n\nIdeal for:\n\n\n\nMaster BedroomGarageDresserWalk-in closetStairsBathroomStore\n\n\n\nPlacement Tips for North Facing Home Vastu\n\n\n\nSlope in a North Facing Home\n\n\n\nSince our ancient legends North direction has been considered highly auspicious as it attracts health and prosperity, therefore, it is advised that no north-facing house should have a slope existing in the North to south direction.\n\n\n\nKitchen\n\n\n\nIn a North-facing house plan, it is advised that the Kitchen should be located either in the southeast or northwest corners. However, the kitchen should never be placed in the northeast corner.\n\n\n\nNo trash accumulation\n\n\n\nAccording to the Vastu, it is advised that any garbage should not be accumulated in the North or northeast corner of the house, as they are the most auspicious corner of the house.\n\n\n\nTrees in a north-facing home\n\n\n\nIt is advised that no trees should be located on the north side of the home as it may become a barrier in attracting good energy to the house.\n\n\n\nPlacement of Holy items\n\n\n\nHoly items in every household are very auspicious, and their placement cannot be compromised. These items include religious symbols such as Swastika, Om, statues, paintings, etc., that cannot be kept anywhere and should be placed appropriately.\n\n\n\nElectricity circuit board\n\n\n\nThe electricity board should be placed in the southeast corner of the house because it is responsible for supplying electricity to the entire house. Placing the board in the southeast zone balances the distribution of energy.\n\n\n\nThe direction of septic tanks\n\n\n\nOne should never place the septic tank around or in the northeast direction.\n\n\n\nPlacement of Bedrooms and Toilets\n\n\n\nAccording to the Vastu of the bedroom, it is advised to construct them in the southwest region. Bathrooms and toilets should never be placed in the corners facing northeast.\n\n\n\nPooja room\n\n\n\nThe pooja room and living room should be placed in the northeast direction.\n\n\n\nGuest room\n\n\n\nA guest room should be in the northwest direction.\n\n\n\nGarage/car parking\n\n\n\nGarage or the parking space should be planned either in the southeast or northwest direction but should be avoided in the north direction as it may cause trouble with the family\u2019s mental peace.\n\n\n\nLevel of land in a north-facing home\n\n\n\nThe main area of concern of the level of the land is the north direction, i.e., the land should not be higher in the north direction, nor the north direction side of the house should be placed higher than the rest of the house. The level of the floors of the entire house should be on the same lower level. It is also believed that if the front portion of the house is on a lower level, then the central room will bring progress.\n\n\n\nHow to ensure luck in the north-facing home?\n\n\n\nAccording to the Vastu Shastra, it is claimed that a north-facing house is the best, and if it is extended to the northeast side, it may bring greater luck. Apartments located in the north direction are not a good idea, but the flow of energy can be regulated by placing an idol of Lord Kuber towards the north direction. Vastu also claims that placing a Tulsi plant in the North, Northeast, or East direction of the house converts any negative energy into positive and brings health and prosperity.\n\n\n\nStaircase placement in north-facing property\n\n\n\nFor the placement of any item or room in a house, a Vastu expert should always be contacted to make the house situated in the aura of positive vibes.\n\n\n\nHere are some quick guidelines to ensure effective placements in a house:\n\n\n\nStaircases should not be placed in the north direction to avoid any financial loss.For the staircase, south, west, southeast, southwest, and northwest directions are considered ideal.To avoid any nerve-related health issues, one should avoid placing staircases in the northeast direction.Staircases should be placed in a clockwise fashion.\n\n\n\nEffects on Women in a North Facing House Plan\n\n\n\nVastu Shastra states that wealth, health, and especially women are affected by the position of the house in a certain direction. Even a woman&#8217;s success is also linked to the house she is living in, so people should be aware of the tips by which they can correct all the Vastu-doshas.\n\n\n\nVastu states that the southeast corner is the home of the planet Venus, which is related to women, so the southeast corner of the house should follow the Vastu related terms; else, the working women or women in the house may face problems and struggles in life.There should be a provision of a well-lit area in the house if the main door or the bedroom door has entrances from the southeast corner.Placement of an open and wide water tank or source of water in the north face is considered helpful for the growth of women.Any damage in the southeast, northwest, or west zone of the house may cause severe health issues or an unsuccessful career for the women.\n\n\n\nWhich people should prefer a North Facing Home?\n\n\n\nPeople with their zodiac or rashi as Cancer, Scorpio, or Pisces find north-facing homes best suitable for them. Even for the people into professions like businesses or finance, such as chartered accountants, accountants, bankers, stock market traders, and investors. The broker finds that north-facing homes are beneficial in their growth. North-facing homes are also best for communication and e-service providers, tour and travel services, astrology and Vastu services, or those in the hospitality sector.\n\n\n\nNorth-facing homes good for Senior Citizens?\n\n\n\nIdeally, according to the Vastu Shastra, it is advised that the head of the family should reside in the southwest or south-facing room. If the head of the family is now retired and involved in spiritual or religious work, he must reside in the room facing North, northeast, and the east to attract prosperity and health.\n\n\n\nThings to avoid in a North Facing House plan\n\n\n\nFollowing are the points that an individual must avoid in their north-facing home:\n\n\n\nNever have the main entrance of the house placed in the northwest direction.No bedrooms, toilets, or kitchens should be placed in the northeast corner of the house.The wastewater runoff should not be located in the north or south direction.Never place the entrance door on the sixth pada.Never go for a north-facing property without looking for any other things that may or may not work in your favour.Gardening should not be done in the northwest direction.The underground tank should be placed in the northwest direction of the house.Never paint your house in red or shades of maroon.Septic tanks should not be located in the North, Northeast, or East direction of the house.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nSince our great mythologies, i.e., Mahabharata and Ramayana that are believed to have existed almost 3000-5000 years ago, the existence and belief in Vastu Shastra also came into power, which cannot be neglected at any cost. When things are placed according to the Vastu, good vibes, energy, and health are attracted, and if not, then many unimaginable, bad things do happen. So, one must always consult Vastu before buying any property and after shifting to a new property. According to Vastu Shastra, no direction is good or bad. Still, a north-facing property is considered most auspicious due to the belief of Lord Kuber. For any doshas, in the rest of the directions, many Vastu doshas tips are also there that help to attract positive energies in non-north-facing properties too.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\nNorth Facing House Vastu Plan for a Peaceful LifeReal Advice from a Real Woman Entrepreneur for Women to Start InvestingHow to Improve Vastu for a South-facing Home?West Facing House Vastu Plan &amp; TipsVastu for Flats &amp; Apartments: 15 Major signs to watch out for\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n\n        \n            \n\t\t\t\tIn which colors can we paint our north-facing home?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tNorth-facing homes can be painted in shades of blue, white, cream, or khaki.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhich corner is best for the placement of the Puja room?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe northeast corner is ideal for the placement of the Puja room in the house.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tFor the placement of things, which southwest direction is ideal?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tSouthwest direction is ideal for dressers, stores, or the placement of staircase.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhy are north-facing properties so popular?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tNorth facing is so popular because, according to our Vastu Shastra, it is believed that the god of wealth, Lord Kuber resides in the north direction, which brings wealth and prosperity to our lives.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tCan mirrors be placed in the south or southeast face of the property?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tNo, mirrors cannot be placed in the south or southeast face of the property.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t\nThe post Vastu Tips &#038; Tricks For North-Facing Home appeared first on Real Estate News.",

            "content_html": "\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">West-facing residences are considered unlucky due to preconceived notions. Vastu experts tell us how to take advantage of the power of west-facing homes to make them more profitable for homeowners. Home purchasers may make unusual decisions to bring prosperity and positive energy into their homes. Some people, for instance, may only desire an east-facing residence, north-facing bedrooms, or perhaps an east-facing kid&#8217;s room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">In truth, west-facing residences are less desirable due to a prevalent misunderstanding that they are unfortunate and inauspicious. According to experts of Vastu Shastra for west-facing homes, all angles are equal yet come with specific restrictions that one should be aware of for positivity to flow freely in the home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Even if a lovely west-facing house is available, numerous real estate brokers or lucrative property advertising will try to persuade you to buy other properties.

If your lounge room does not have enough space for this, you can position your living room inside the north and a tiny temple or pooja stand inside the north part.While verifying the directional face of the property, use a magnetic compass to trace the precise west.Make sure the current house&#8217;s main entrance is only in the third or fourth padas.Build the walls mainly on the south and west sides of the building- a bit thicker and taller than those on the east and north sides.Place your living room as well as the Pooja room at the northeast corner of the house, as this is the most auspicious part of the house.If you don&#8217;t have a pooja room, install the temple inside the living room&#8217;s north part.Make sure the kid&#8217;s room is facing either west, south, or north-west.If your plot is slanted, ensure that it is slanted from south to north.\n\n\n\nThings you must avoid\n\n\n\nAvoid using the setting sun to discover the precise west direction.Except for the ones listed, avoid all other padas unless you visit a Vastu specialist beforehand.Avoid buying land with a north-to-south slope since it may result in financial losses.Avoid buying a parcel of land or a house with a southwest or south direction expansion.A bore well, a storage tank or a sump should not be located in the southwest corner of a west-facing residence.A kitchen should not be placed in the house&#8217;s southwest corner.Sleeping beneath a beam or a wall divider is not a good idea.Make sure your legs aren&#8217;t pointed towards the bedroom door as you sleep.Purchase a property with a South and West border that is thinner than the East and North boundaries.Avoid any home with the main entrance blocked by a huge item such as a tree or an electric pole.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nAs can be seen, the Vastu of west facing property is just as excellent as any other Vastu. All you have to do now is make sure you follow all of the Vastu regulations. If you are building a house on a plot, it is rather simple. However, if you are moving to a flat or apartment, you may face several difficulties. It is frequently impossible to carry out a remodel that necessitates structural changes.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\nHow to Improve Vastu for a South-facing Home?Vastu for Flats &amp; Apartments: 15 Major signs to watch out forNorth Facing House Vastu Plan for a Peaceful LifeWest Facing House Vastu Plan &amp; TipsWest Facing House Vastu Plan\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n\n        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhere is the sun from a west-facing house?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom mid-evening to sunset, west-facing residences receive sunshine.

            "content_html": "\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The kitchen is the heart of the home; therefore, it is indispensable to have a positive vibe in the kitchen and avoid all sorts of negative energies. The Vastu Shastra tips that are written in ancient times are impeccable for maintaining positivity in the kitchen. Vastu Shastra is an ancient Indian art that harnesses the energy of natural elements like the heat and light of the sun, the gravitational force of the earth, the direction of the winds, the intensity of rainfall, etc. It uses them to balance with the surroundings of mankind. There are certain rules in Vastu Shastra that are written solely to balance the kitchen interiors from the energies generated by these elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-significance-of-kitchen-vastu\">Significance of Kitchen Vastu</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The kitchen is an integral part of every home. It is considered the second most sacred place in the house, after the pooja room. This is why people spend a lot of money to construct the best kitchen interiors possible, starting from flooring, cupboards, furnishing, counters, etc. But no matter how much people invest in the kitchen, it would still be useless if it is not according to the Vastu Shastra rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The food we cook here on our own and eat differentiates a home from a hotel or any other place. Be it a wife, a husband or a parent and a child, every one of us would have different memories associated with the kitchen. So, as long as food is an essential part of our living, the kitchen will remain an integral part of our home. Hence, Vastu Sastra has given us numerous rules that would help us radiate positive energy in the kitchen at all times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">For a human to stay healthy and live long, eating nutritious food is a pressing priority. The outside food in restaurants and food courts is entirely unhealthy as we never know what quality of ingredients are used. Make sure that there is always a positive aura in your kitchen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Not following the Vastu rules would result in an imbalance of energy in your kitchen, resulting in a high amount of negative energy. This negative energy affects the food made in the kitchen and, thereby, our physical and mental health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">According to Vastu Shastra, there are 5 key elements in this universe (the Panchatatva) \u2013 namely air, water, earth, space, and fire. Having a perfect balance of all these 5 elements is what makes the kitchen fill with positive energy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-location-of-the-kitchen\">Location of the Kitchen</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Where the things inside the kitchen come under secondary, the location of the kitchen is the primary aspect to concentrate on. The kitchen is where we turn raw vegetables, fruits, or nuts into healthy, edible food. For such a process, the key element is fire. Another essential element is water as we use it for cleaning purposes. Balancing these 2 elements, along with the earth, sky, and the air is the key aspect on which the kitchen Vastu is decided.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">According to Vastu Shastra, the South-East direction is related to Agni, the god of fire. Lord Agni represents fire, and since fire is the main element to satisfy the kitchen&#8217;s purpose, the kitchen should be located in the South-East direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">While the South-East direction is always the primary choice, finding a house fulfilling this requirement is not always possible. The direction of the kitchen keeps changing depending on the facing of the house. So, in cases where the kitchen is not in the southeast direction, the northwest direction is acceptable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Avoid the construction of the kitchen in the north, north-east, or south-west directions as it is strictly against the rules of the Vastu Shastra. Also, the inclination for the flow of water should be from the southwest towards the northeast.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-placement-of-the-fire-element\">The Placement of the Fire Element</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">In ancient times wooden logs were used, and over the course of time, the wooden logs were slowly replaced by LPG (Liquified Petroleum Gas) cylinders. Almost all the people in India have shifted to using cylinders like HP or Indane. There is also a further upgrade to using electricity for cooking. But no matter which among the above options it is, the food is still considered to be cooked with the energy of fire. Hence, the placement of all fire elements should be done accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The gas stove is the main source of fire, and hence it should compulsorily be placed in the southeast direction. The fire is a huge form of energy and placing the stove in the southeast direction would properly manage and handle that element. Even if it is a northwest kitchen, it should be made sure that the stove is placed in the southeast direction. Another essential point to remember is that the stove should be placed so that the person turning on the stove (i.e., lighting the fire) should always face the east, i.e., we should always be cooking while facing the east direction. The gas cylinders should also be placed in the southeast zone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">As said above, not just stoves but all appliances, like the electric rice cooker, microwave oven, bread toaster, coffee machine, etc., would all come under things used for cooking and hence they all should also be in the right direction. Since these electrical appliances are also used for cooking, they are also a representation of fire and should be placed in the southeast direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-refrigerator-other-appliances\">Refrigerator &amp; Other Appliances</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Electrical appliances like a mixer or wet-grinder should always be preferred to be placed in the northeast direction. But when it comes to heavy machines or utensils, like the fridge or any huge water storage, drums should be placed in the southwest direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">No matter where the placement is, always keep in mind that everything should be at least a foot above the floor and a foot away from the corners. Give the slightest preference to the northeast direction when it comes to keeping electrical appliances.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-watch-out-for-the-position-of-the-wash-basin\">Watch Out for the Position of the Wash Basin</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">According to Vastu Shastra experts, water is an opposite element to fire. The fire and water always repel each other, which gives negative energy. Hence, it is important to properly balance the fire and water elements to avoid negative energies in the kitchen. And to balance this, the wash basins or sinks in the kitchen should be placed away from cooking devices. This includes that the stove, gas cylinder, microwave oven, electrical coffee maker, etc., should all not be placed parallel or near the wash basin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The north or northeast directions in the kitchen are the best for wash basins and the water pipes connected. In many houses, the washing machine connection is also given in the kitchen. In such cases, the washing machine should also be placed in the northeast direction, but a foot away from the corners and a foot above the ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-storage\">Storage</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Cupboards, shelves, etc., are all storage units where we place all the groceries, grains, rice, and many more ingredients. The placement of storage units is hence important for us to ensure that we are blessed with the groceries all along the year and that we would never run out of shortage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">All the storage units should be in the kitchen\u2019s southwest direction. If you have a habit of storing cooked food in the kitchen itself, then make sure that you place it in the southwest only.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Another important point to note is never store grains near the eastern or northern walls.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-entrance-and-ventilation\">Entrance and Ventilation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Following the Vastu shastra rules for the kitchen entrance would complete the architecture with everything in the right placements. The entrance could mostly be in either north, east or west directions. There are no specific rules about how the entrance should look, but the only point to remember is, if it is a corner entrance, then make sure to leave at least an inch gap from the wall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Windows are also an integral part of the kitchen. Without a window, the kitchen would be suffocated due to the vapors and the smoke coming while cooking. They let in sunlight during the daytime. The windows are also the key opening through which all the negative energy generated in the kitchen gets out. So always make sure to keep the windows open while cooking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">If there is more than one window, make sure to place them in the same direction. The exhaust fan should also be placed on the same wall as the windows, and a chimney outlet should also be in the east zone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-flooring-and-wall-colors\">Flooring and Wall Colors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Vastu Shastra experts recommended that for the kitchen area the warm and neutral tone colours are the best as it gives out a calm vibe. Hence such pleasant colours should always be preferred.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The preferable paint colors for kitchen walls are pink, yellow, red, orange, or chocolate brown. There is also a scientific theory that these colors invoke hunger which is an additional plus point. Neither white nor black are preferred, and all extra-dark colors should be avoided.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The flooring could be of wooden, marble, or ceramic tiles. The cupboard work can be of any material, but make sure that the cupboard colors are also light. If you want to choose dark colors for cupboards, then make sure that they are dark and light.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-can-the-dining-table-be-inside-the-kitchen\">Can the Dining Table be Inside the Kitchen?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">In cases where the kitchen area is huge, some people prefer placing the dining table inside the kitchen itself, instead of having a separate dining room. Vastu Shastra does not oppose the dining table in the kitchen, but care should be taken in its placement. According to the Vastu Shastra, the dining table should be placed in the northwest direction and never be in the center of the kitchen. If the northwest is occupied, then try either the north or the west direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Also, make sure that there is no bathroom entrance facing the dining table.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-some-important-points-to-remember\">Some Important Points to Remember</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The kitchen should never be located under or above the bedroom, pooja room, or bathroom.</li><li>The Vastu Shastra also states that it is unhealthy for the kitchen and a bathroom to share a common wall.</li><li>The stove or the gas cylinder should never be directly in front of the kitchen\u2019s entrance.</li><li>Heavy things should never be placed in the east or north directions of the kitchen.</li><li>The kitchen dustbin should be under the kitchen sink, and make sure to place all wastes in the dustbin. The dustbin should also be cleared regularly.</li><li>The kitchen should be neat and clean to ensure positive energy at all times.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-you-might-also-like\">You Might Also Like</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-yoast-seo-related-links\"><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/kitchen-vastu-defects\">Kitchen Vastu Defects and Some Common Remedies</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/top-5-tips-for-a-sustainable-home\">Top 5 Tips for a Sustainable Home</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/vastu-for-flats\">Vastu for Flats &amp; Apartments: 15 Major signs to watch out for</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/how-to-fight-with-coronavirus\">How to Fight with Coronavirus?</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/west-facing-house-vastu-plan-tips\">West Facing House Vastu Plan &amp; Tips</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-frequently-asked-questions-faq-s\">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ&#8217;s)</h2>\n\n\n        <section class=\"sc_fs_faq sc_card\">\n            <div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>In which direction should a window be placed in the kitchen?</h2>                <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe windows should be placed on the east or west side of the kitchen, preferably east.                    </p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </section>\n\t        <section class=\"sc_fs_faq sc_card\">\n            <div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Can I hang a clock in the kitchen?</h2>                <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you want to hang a clock, prefer the south or the south-west wall.                    </p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </section>\n\t        <section class=\"sc_fs_faq sc_card\">\n            <div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Where can Water storing commodities be located?</h2>                <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWater storing commodities like earthen pots, water filters, RO purifiers, etc., should also be placed in the northeast direction.                    </p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </section>\n\t        <section class=\"sc_fs_faq sc_card\">\n            <div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Where should the gas stove be placed?</h2>                <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe gas stove is the main source of the fire.

The Vastu Shastra tips that are written in ancient times are impeccable for maintaining positivity in the kitchen. Vastu Shastra is an ancient Indian art that harnesses the energy of natural elements like the heat and light of the sun, the gravitational force of the earth, the direction of the winds, the intensity of rainfall, etc. It uses them to balance with the surroundings of mankind. There are certain rules in Vastu Shastra that are written solely to balance the kitchen interiors from the energies generated by these elements.\n\n\n\nSignificance of Kitchen Vastu\n\n\n\nThe kitchen is an integral part of every home. It is considered the second most sacred place in the house, after the pooja room. This is why people spend a lot of money to construct the best kitchen interiors possible, starting from flooring, cupboards, furnishing, counters, etc. But no matter how much people invest in the kitchen, it would still be useless if it is not according to the Vastu Shastra rules.\n\n\n\nThe food we cook here on our own and eat differentiates a home from a hotel or any other place. Be it a wife, a husband or a parent and a child, every one of us would have different memories associated with the kitchen. So, as long as food is an essential part of our living, the kitchen will remain an integral part of our home. Hence, Vastu Sastra has given us numerous rules that would help us radiate positive energy in the kitchen at all times.\n\n\n\nFor a human to stay healthy and live long, eating nutritious food is a pressing priority. The outside food in restaurants and food courts is entirely unhealthy as we never know what quality of ingredients are used. Make sure that there is always a positive aura in your kitchen.\n\n\n\nNot following the Vastu rules would result in an imbalance of energy in your kitchen, resulting in a high amount of negative energy. This negative energy affects the food made in the kitchen and, thereby, our physical and mental health.\n\n\n\nAccording to Vastu Shastra, there are 5 key elements in this universe (the Panchatatva) \u2013 namely air, water, earth, space, and fire. Having a perfect balance of all these 5 elements is what makes the kitchen fill with positive energy.\n\n\n\nLocation of the Kitchen\n\n\n\nWhere the things inside the kitchen come under secondary, the location of the kitchen is the primary aspect to concentrate on. The kitchen is where we turn raw vegetables, fruits, or nuts into healthy, edible food. For such a process, the key element is fire. Another essential element is water as we use it for cleaning purposes. Balancing these 2 elements, along with the earth, sky, and the air is the key aspect on which the kitchen Vastu is decided.\n\n\n\nAccording to Vastu Shastra, the South-East direction is related to Agni, the god of fire. Lord Agni represents fire, and since fire is the main element to satisfy the kitchen&#8217;s purpose, the kitchen should be located in the South-East direction.\n\n\n\nWhile the South-East direction is always the primary choice, finding a house fulfilling this requirement is not always possible. The direction of the kitchen keeps changing depending on the facing of the house. So, in cases where the kitchen is not in the southeast direction, the northwest direction is acceptable.\n\n\n\nAvoid the construction of the kitchen in the north, north-east, or south-west directions as it is strictly against the rules of the Vastu Shastra. Also, the inclination for the flow of water should be from the southwest towards the northeast.\n\n\n\nThe Placement of the Fire Element\n\n\n\nIn ancient times wooden logs were used, and over the course of time, the wooden logs were slowly replaced by LPG (Liquified Petroleum Gas) cylinders. Almost all the people in India have shifted to using cylinders like HP or Indane. There is also a further upgrade to using electricity for cooking. But no matter which among the above options it is, the food is still considered to be cooked with the energy of fire. Hence, the placement of all fire elements should be done accordingly.\n\n\n\nThe gas stove is the main source of fire, and hence it should compulsorily be placed in the southeast direction. The fire is a huge form of energy and placing the stove in the southeast direction would properly manage and handle that element. Even if it is a northwest kitchen, it should be made sure that the stove is placed in the southeast direction. Another essential point to remember is that the stove should be placed so that the person turning on the stove (i.e., lighting the fire) should always face the east, i.e., we should always be cooking while facing the east direction. The gas cylinders should also be placed in the southeast zone.\n\n\n\nAs said above, not just stoves but all appliances, like the electric rice cooker, microwave oven, bread toaster, coffee machine, etc., would all come under things used for cooking and hence they all should also be in the right direction. Since these electrical appliances are also used for cooking, they are also a representation of fire and should be placed in the southeast direction.\n\n\n\nRefrigerator &amp; Other Appliances\n\n\n\nElectrical appliances like a mixer or wet-grinder should always be preferred to be placed in the northeast direction. But when it comes to heavy machines or utensils, like the fridge or any huge water storage, drums should be placed in the southwest direction.\n\n\n\nNo matter where the placement is, always keep in mind that everything should be at least a foot above the floor and a foot away from the corners. Give the slightest preference to the northeast direction when it comes to keeping electrical appliances.\n\n\n\nWatch Out for the Position of the Wash Basin\n\n\n\nAccording to Vastu Shastra experts, water is an opposite element to fire. The fire and water always repel each other, which gives negative energy. Hence, it is important to properly balance the fire and water elements to avoid negative energies in the kitchen. And to balance this, the wash basins or sinks in the kitchen should be placed away from cooking devices. This includes that the stove, gas cylinder, microwave oven, electrical coffee maker, etc., should all not be placed parallel or near the wash basin.\n\n\n\nThe north or northeast directions in the kitchen are the best for wash basins and the water pipes connected. In many houses, the washing machine connection is also given in the kitchen. In such cases, the washing machine should also be placed in the northeast direction, but a foot away from the corners and a foot above the ground.\n\n\n\nStorage\n\n\n\nCupboards, shelves, etc., are all storage units where we place all the groceries, grains, rice, and many more ingredients. The placement of storage units is hence important for us to ensure that we are blessed with the groceries all along the year and that we would never run out of shortage.\n\n\n\nAll the storage units should be in the kitchen\u2019s southwest direction. If you have a habit of storing cooked food in the kitchen itself, then make sure that you place it in the southwest only.\n\n\n\nAnother important point to note is never store grains near the eastern or northern walls.\n\n\n\nEntrance and Ventilation\n\n\n\nFollowing the Vastu shastra rules for the kitchen entrance would complete the architecture with everything in the right placements. The entrance could mostly be in either north, east or west directions. There are no specific rules about how the entrance should look, but the only point to remember is, if it is a corner entrance, then make sure to leave at least an inch gap from the wall.\n\n\n\nWindows are also an integral part of the kitchen. Without a window, the kitchen would be suffocated due to the vapors and the smoke coming while cooking. They let in sunlight during the daytime. The windows are also the key opening through which all the negative energy generated in the kitchen gets out. So always make sure to keep the windows open while cooking.\n\n\n\nIf there is more than one window, make sure to place them in the same direction. The exhaust fan should also be placed on the same wall as the windows, and a chimney outlet should also be in the east zone.\n\n\n\nFlooring and Wall Colors\n\n\n\nVastu Shastra experts recommended that for the kitchen area the warm and neutral tone colours are the best as it gives out a calm vibe. Hence such pleasant colours should always be preferred.\n\n\n\nThe preferable paint colors for kitchen walls are pink, yellow, red, orange, or chocolate brown. There is also a scientific theory that these colors invoke hunger which is an additional plus point. Neither white nor black are preferred, and all extra-dark colors should be avoided.\n\n\n\nThe flooring could be of wooden, marble, or ceramic tiles. The cupboard work can be of any material, but make sure that the cupboard colors are also light. If you want to choose dark colors for cupboards, then make sure that they are dark and light.\n\n\n\nCan the Dining Table be Inside the Kitchen?\n\n\n\nIn cases where the kitchen area is huge, some people prefer placing the dining table inside the kitchen itself, instead of having a separate dining room. Vastu Shastra does not oppose the dining table in the kitchen, but care should be taken in its placement. According to the Vastu Shastra, the dining table should be placed in the northwest direction and never be in the center of the kitchen. If the northwest is occupied, then try either the north or the west direction.\n\n\n\nAlso, make sure that there is no bathroom entrance facing the dining table.\n\n\n\nSome Important Points to Remember\n\n\n\nThe kitchen should never be located under or above the bedroom, pooja room, or bathroom.The Vastu Shastra also states that it is unhealthy for the kitchen and a bathroom to share a common wall.The stove or the gas cylinder should never be directly in front of the kitchen\u2019s entrance.Heavy things should never be placed in the east or north directions of the kitchen.The kitchen dustbin should be under the kitchen sink, and make sure to place all wastes in the dustbin. The dustbin should also be cleared regularly.The kitchen should be neat and clean to ensure positive energy at all times.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\nKitchen Vastu Defects and Some Common RemediesTop 5 Tips for a Sustainable HomeVastu for Flats &amp; Apartments: 15 Major signs to watch out forHow to Fight with Coronavirus?West Facing House Vastu Plan &amp; Tips\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ&#8217;s)\n\n\n        \n            \n\t\t\t\tIn which direction should a window be placed in the kitchen?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe windows should be placed on the east or west side of the kitchen, preferably east.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tCan I hang a clock in the kitchen?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you want to hang a clock, prefer the south or the south-west wall.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhere can Water storing commodities be located?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tWater storing commodities like earthen pots, water filters, RO purifiers, etc., should also be placed in the northeast direction.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhere should the gas stove be placed?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe gas stove is the main source of the fire.

This is considered auspicious.\u00a0\r\n\u00d8 The walls of the living room which are on the north and east sides should be marginally thinner as well as shorter than the others. This is expected to help in bringing success in both, professional as well as personal lives.\u00a0\r\nPooja Rooms\u00a0\r\n\u00d8 Pooja room Vastu in the east-facing house is typically supposed to be in the northeast direction. As this is the most important room for religious people, no alterations should be made for its placement.\u00a0\r\nKitchens\r\n\u00d8 Kitchens are an important part of the house and need to be placed in the southeast or northwest direction of the house.\u00a0\r\nWhile the above-mentioned rooms are the main ones, other rooms such as guest rooms, balconies, study rooms, children&#8217;s rooms, etc. also each have their own sets of rules as per Vastu Shastra and have been mentioned in the table in the segment above.

These are different from north east facing house Vastu plans or any north east facing house.

Independent houses and bungalows will not have this east facing house plan as per Vastu.

Make sure that the entrance is exactly at the middle and not in the north east or south east.

When the <strong>temple</strong> or <strong>prayer area</strong> is properly constructed as per <strong>Vastu Shastra</strong>, it can provide the home and its inhabitant\u2019s health, wealth, and happiness. While every Indian household has a puja room, have you ever pondered why some give off a positive feeling as soon as you walk in, while others don&#8217;t? The answer might be because only a few individuals are familiar with <strong>Vastu</strong> concepts. To make things easier for you, we&#8217;ve compiled a list of the most significant puja room Vastu guidelines for your home. Continue reading to learn more.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What is the best way to construct a temple at home, as per Vastu?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When erecting the temple, avoid placing it straight on the ground. Well, Nitien Parmar of VastuPlus suggests keeping it on a higher platform or pedestal. Either stonework or timber should be used to construct the temple. Glass or acrylic temples should be avoided. Do not overcrowd the temple. Make sure you don&#8217;t have several idols of the same Deity in the temple, whether they&#8217;re sitting or standing. \u201cIdols or pictures put in the temple should not be broken or torn, as this is regarded as unlucky,\u201d Parmar of VastuPlus advises.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pujas ought to be performed wherever the temple is located. The entire family usually prays together during festivities. As a result, make sure there is adequate room for the entire family to assemble and pray. The aura in the temple area should be healthy and balanced. So make it tidy and free of dust and insects, and don&#8217;t overcrowd the area with too many embellishments.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What is the right direction to locate your puja room at home?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your puja room&#8217;s placement is essential in determining its auspicious ambiance. The best direction is north-east, followed by east and north. If you&#8217;re building a new house and have discretion over where your puja room is located, we highly advise you to avoid the basement or upper levels. It&#8217;s ideal if your prayer room is built on the ground level.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You must be wondering what the logic behind this is. Vastu Shastra promotes the north-east direction to maximize solar energy harvesting. Furthermore, the earth is also tilted towards the northeast direction. As a result, the northeast direction is considered auspicious since it allows the prayer area to draw all of the home&#8217;s energy towards it and then propel it forward. Not only that but it is said that Jupiter is the lord of the same direction. Consequently, this direction is referred to as <strong>Ishan Kona</strong> or Home of Jupiter.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What is the ideal way to design your puja room?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ceiling in your puja room should be low. A pyramid-shaped upper surface will help to create a peaceful environment. If there is enough room, a threshold and two-door entry must be taken into consideration. According to Vastu Shastra, installing only one door is not recommended. This is due to the fact that a single, outward-opening door might get in the way of the person praying, disrupting their state of mind. If you don&#8217;t have enough space or money to construct a door, simply drape a curtain to function as a temporary doorway.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since the puja room is compact, the lower ceiling, along with the pyramid-shaped structure offers equilibrium and makes it easier to enter a spiritual experience. The purpose of a threshold is to keep bugs and pests out of sacred areas.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What is the best way to place idols in the temple?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It&#8217;s time to put in your idols once your puja room&#8217;s design and construction are complete. A few inches away from the wall and at least six inches from the floor would be preferable. Deceased people&#8217;s portraits and artworks showing violence have no place in your puja room.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To maintain consistent air movement around the idol, it should be placed away from the wall. This also helps to surround the deity with the scent of the incense sticks.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How should I store things in the puja room?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Are you unsure about where to put all of your religious literature, candles, and puja items? Storage must always face south-east. Why you may ask? Storage should face south-east to ensure that sunlight is not obstructed. Additionally, there should be no storage above the deity. All storage must be placed under the idols. Disrespect is shown by storing items above idols. It also has an impact on the free movement of energy and light. This is not only helpful in terms of Vastu, but it is also practical because items placed at ground level are easily accessible.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What should be the colour of the puja room?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The colour of the prayer room should be according to the Vastu guidelines. Vastu Shastra recommends subdued colours for maintaining the serenity of a puja area. Whites, soft blues, and pastel yellow are all appropriate colours. In a puja room, gloomy colours should be avoided since these will not create a peaceful atmosphere in a place of worship and can be distracting instead. The majority of temple units in Indian houses, however, are constructed of dark wood. This is a Vastu Dosha that prevents divinity from entering your household. If you already have a dark-colored puja unit that you don&#8217;t want to replace, consider painting the wall behind it with a bright colour. To counteract the gloomy colour, the bright colour offers enough illumination to the unit.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Likewise, for the flooring of your puja area, choose white marble or any light-colored marble tiling.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What should be the lighting of the puja room?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What&#8217;s not to like about a space that&#8217;s bright? And, more importantly, a bright puja room? As it will be the smallest room in your house, it will require bright lighting. With a window facing northeast, light up your prayer area with Diyas. If this isn&#8217;t possible, make do with plenty of artificial lighting.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not only will your puja room be bright, but you&#8217;ll also have enough air and be able to sit comfortably while praying for lengthy periods of time if you have a north-east facing window.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Have a Small Apartment? Here are some tips for the ideal prayer room.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">People in today&#8217;s world of nuclear families and small flats don&#8217;t have the luxury of devoting an entire room to praying. The trend for compact fully prepared puja mandaps that can be mounted on walls and hallways has increased as a result.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Living Room</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The greatest spot to install a puja unit in a small flat is in the living room. If you have empty shelves in your entertainment unit, you may create a separate puja room by decorating a tiny section. For those who spend long hours in meditation and prayer, however, solitude and focus will continue to be a problem.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Kitchen</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A kitchen cabinet may be customized to function as a miniature temple. It is advised to make the cabinet door have chiseled edges and shapely openings on its surface so that smoke can be properly dispersed when diyas and fragrance sticks are lighted.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Corners</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Placing up a series of elegant pedestals so that the idols are a few inches above the ground level may quickly transform an empty corner of the dining room into a puja space. Small lights can be placed above the idols to brighten the prayer area. If you need seclusion, hang a little curtain beneath the top shelf to keep the idols hidden from view.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cupboards</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why not construct a closet for the deities with sophisticated customizable doors and shelves while constructing a cupboard for everyday use goods at home? This can be the ultimate space-saving puja area for a tiny flat. For further decoration, you can add brass fittings on the cabinet sides and broad shelves with roomy drawers at the bottom.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Designing a temple at home: what to do and what not to do</strong></p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>To maintain the sacredness of the holy place, the puja room should always be separated by doors. As per Vastu, a puja space without a door is inauspicious. This is because the pious spirits inside a puja room might wane if there isn&#8217;t a door.</li>\n<li>A Diya, lamp, or anything else you light in the puja space as per religion must be lit on the right-hand side of the person offering prayers.</li>\n<li>Maintain a clutter-free and spotless puja space.</li>\n<li>Ensure that an electric switchboard is located near the temple so that the area may be lit up during festive occasions.</li>\n<li>When worshiping in the puja room, idols and pictures of God must never face each other; deities facing north or east are regarded as auspicious.</li>\n<li>The shrine should be built high enough for the statues&#8217; feet to be at the level of the chest of the person who is worshiping. Never put the god statue down on the ground.</li>\n<li>A temple or puja area cannot be built against a wall with a bathroom behind it. The justification for not placing the sacred space next to the restroom is to prevent bad energy from entering the house.</li>\n<li>Bold or dark hues, such as black, gray, or any other gloomy hue, should never be used in the prayer area.</li>\n<li>Avoid putting trash cans in the puja area since this raises the chances of bad energy flowing through the atmosphere.</li>\n<li>Remove any wilted flowers from the puja space. As soon as the flowers and foliage lose their freshness, remove them from this area.</li>\n<li>It is deemed inauspicious to place the puja area under a stairway or against the toilet wall. It is considered a big Vastu dosha.</li>\n<li>When storing water, make use of copper vessels rather than glass or low-cost metals such as aluminium.</li>\n<li>To get the greatest benefits, place the puja ghar on the bottom level of your house. According to Vastu, mandirs should not be built in basements or on upper levels.</li>\n<li>According to Vastu Shastra, you should not have a temple in your bedroom. If you absolutely have to place it in the bedroom, make sure your feet aren&#8217;t facing the temple.</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>FAQs</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Where in the house should the puja area be located?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Building a puja room should be done in the northeast, east, or north orientations. These directions are said to be the luckiest. To guarantee that the puja rooms are free of bad energy, keep them away from the stairwells and restrooms.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Which sort of mandir is suitable for use at home?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A mandir built of wood, as per Vastu Shastra, is auspicious and regarded more holy. Apart from other wood kinds, Sheesham Wood (Rosewood) is deemed blessed for temples.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Which metal is considered propitious for puja?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is recommended to utilize objects made of clay, silver, copper, or gold in a puja. Favorable energies are easily received by these things. Owing to the high cost of silver and gold, it may be more cost-effective to use copper, brass, or stone items.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Which items should be avoided in the puja room?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Leather is regarded as an impure material to keep in the mandir. The temple space must not contain any animal skin. Also, don&#8217;t store cash in the puja room. While it is not deemed unclean, saving/storing money at a place where you seek serenity and prosperity is not deemed appropriate.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What Colour scheme should you choose in your puja room? </strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Choose pastel colours such as white, blue and yellow. These emit a sense of calm and tranquilly that is conducive to prayer.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/prayer-room-vastu-shastra-tips-for-a-peaceful-home\">Prayer Room Vastu Shastra Tips For A Peaceful Home</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog\">Real Estate News</a>.</p>\n",

If you already have a dark-colored puja unit that you don&#8217;t want to replace, consider painting the wall behind it with a bright colour. To counteract the gloomy colour, the bright colour offers enough illumination to the unit.\nLikewise, for the flooring of your puja area, choose white marble or any light-colored marble tiling.\nWhat should be the lighting of the puja room?\nWhat&#8217;s not to like about a space that&#8217;s bright? And, more importantly, a bright puja room? As it will be the smallest room in your house, it will require bright lighting. With a window facing northeast, light up your prayer area with Diyas. If this isn&#8217;t possible, make do with plenty of artificial lighting.\nNot only will your puja room be bright, but you&#8217;ll also have enough air and be able to sit comfortably while praying for lengthy periods of time if you have a north-east facing window.\nHave a Small Apartment? Here are some tips for the ideal prayer room.\nPeople in today&#8217;s world of nuclear families and small flats don&#8217;t have the luxury of devoting an entire room to praying. The trend for compact fully prepared puja mandaps that can be mounted on walls and hallways has increased as a result.\nLiving Room\nThe greatest spot to install a puja unit in a small flat is in the living room. If you have empty shelves in your entertainment unit, you may create a separate puja room by decorating a tiny section. For those who spend long hours in meditation and prayer, however, solitude and focus will continue to be a problem.\nKitchen\nA kitchen cabinet may be customized to function as a miniature temple. It is advised to make the cabinet door have chiseled edges and shapely openings on its surface so that smoke can be properly dispersed when diyas and fragrance sticks are lighted.\nCorners\nPlacing up a series of elegant pedestals so that the idols are a few inches above the ground level may quickly transform an empty corner of the dining room into a puja space. Small lights can be placed above the idols to brighten the prayer area. If you need seclusion, hang a little curtain beneath the top shelf to keep the idols hidden from view.\nCupboards\nWhy not construct a closet for the deities with sophisticated customizable doors and shelves while constructing a cupboard for everyday use goods at home? This can be the ultimate space-saving puja area for a tiny flat. For further decoration, you can add brass fittings on the cabinet sides and broad shelves with roomy drawers at the bottom.\nDesigning a temple at home: what to do and what not to do\n\nTo maintain the sacredness of the holy place, the puja room should always be separated by doors. As per Vastu, a puja space without a door is inauspicious. This is because the pious spirits inside a puja room might wane if there isn&#8217;t a door.\nA Diya, lamp, or anything else you light in the puja space as per religion must be lit on the right-hand side of the person offering prayers.\nMaintain a clutter-free and spotless puja space.\nEnsure that an electric switchboard is located near the temple so that the area may be lit up during festive occasions.\nWhen worshiping in the puja room, idols and pictures of God must never face each other; deities facing north or east are regarded as auspicious.\nThe shrine should be built high enough for the statues&#8217; feet to be at the level of the chest of the person who is worshiping. Never put the god statue down on the ground.\nA temple or puja area cannot be built against a wall with a bathroom behind it. The justification for not placing the sacred space next to the restroom is to prevent bad energy from entering the house.\nBold or dark hues, such as black, gray, or any other gloomy hue, should never be used in the prayer area.\nAvoid putting trash cans in the puja area since this raises the chances of bad energy flowing through the atmosphere.\nRemove any wilted flowers from the puja space. As soon as the flowers and foliage lose their freshness, remove them from this area.\nIt is deemed inauspicious to place the puja area under a stairway or against the toilet wall. It is considered a big Vastu dosha.\nWhen storing water, make use of copper vessels rather than glass or low-cost metals such as aluminium.\nTo get the greatest benefits, place the puja ghar on the bottom level of your house. According to Vastu, mandirs should not be built in basements or on upper levels.\nAccording to Vastu Shastra, you should not have a temple in your bedroom. If you absolutely have to place it in the bedroom, make sure your feet aren&#8217;t facing the temple.\n\nFAQs\nWhere in the house should the puja area be located?\nBuilding a puja room should be done in the northeast, east, or north orientations. These directions are said to be the luckiest. To guarantee that the puja rooms are free of bad energy, keep them away from the stairwells and restrooms.\nWhich sort of mandir is suitable for use at home?\nA mandir built of wood, as per Vastu Shastra, is auspicious and regarded more holy. Apart from other wood kinds, Sheesham Wood (Rosewood) is deemed blessed for temples.\nWhich metal is considered propitious for puja?\nIt is recommended to utilize objects made of clay, silver, copper, or gold in a puja. Favorable energies are easily received by these things. Owing to the high cost of silver and gold, it may be more cost-effective to use copper, brass, or stone items.\nWhich items should be avoided in the puja room?\nLeather is regarded as an impure material to keep in the mandir. The temple space must not contain any animal skin. Also, don&#8217;t store cash in the puja room. While it is not deemed unclean, saving/storing money at a place where you seek serenity and prosperity is not deemed appropriate.\nWhat Colour scheme should you choose in your puja room? \nChoose pastel colours such as white, blue and yellow. These emit a sense of calm and tranquilly that is conducive to prayer.\nThe post Prayer Room Vastu Shastra Tips For A Peaceful Home appeared first on Real Estate News.",

Vastu is an important aspect when it comes to any real estate and today many developers are aware of it and work according to its principles.</p>\n<p>The starting point is the main door of any property which brings energy into the house. The front door is expected to bring good luck, good fortune, and positivity into the house. Certain directions for the main door are good according to Vastu and some directions can lead to Vastu defects. So, we are with some Vastu tips for the main door</p>\n<p>The main objective of Vastu shastra is to integrate architecture with nature.</p>\n<p><strong>The direction of the Main door</strong></p>\n<p>Vastu principles suggest the north, east, northeast, and west are the most favorable directions for the front door. Vastu does not recommend having the main door in the south, southeastern, and northwestern directions. But Vastu has a cure of conditions that cannot be changed and there are ways to compensate for the undesirable directions. One way is to get the front door made in different combinations of wood and metal.</p>\n<p>Vastu shastra recommends setting up different combinations of pyramids and helixes of different inauspicious directions that some front doors open to. Directions of doors in the southwest or southern directions can be compensated by using a lead helix and a lead metal pyramidal combination. An undesirable northwest direction of the main door is recommended for correction by getting the pyramid and helix made of brass. Vastu experts and practitioners recommend the use of a helix made of copper to correct a Vastu defect made led by the door in the southeast direction.</p>\n<p><strong>The best material according to Vastu for the main door</strong></p>\n<p>Among materials used for the main door, the most auspicious one is wood. But if there are Vastu defects of direction, various types of metal combined with wood shall be required for specific direction. For the defect of the south direction, a combination of wood and metal is recommended. Metalwork on the main door is advised if it faces the west. For the favourable directions of east and north, there are some special guidelines. North facing doors can have silver colour doors but for the east, minimal metal on a primarily wooden door works according to Vastu.</p>\n<p><strong>Main door and its visibility as per Vastu</strong></p>\n<p>The main door of any building, house, or establishment is required to be the biggest, ornate and conspicuous. The Main Door is required to open in the clockwise direction and it should be at least 7 feet in height and three feet in width. Vastu shastra recommends that the other doors in the house should be shorter than the height of the main door.</p>\n<p><strong>Vastu and its origins</strong></p>\n<p>The actual name of Vastu shastra is Vastu Shilpa Shastra and it is found in a section of the Atharva Ved which is the Stapatya Ved. It makes Vastu Shashtra, a science that is thousands of years old. The prime essence of Vastu Shastra is the effect of sun rays falling on different areas of a building.\u00a0Vastu shastra was a purely technical subject and was practiced by ancient architects and designers.

Armed with the boon, the spirit went on to wreak havoc until it was overpowered by 81 Gods led by lord Brahma who had the now repentant spirit face down. Lord Brahma placed a conditional boon to the spirit, saying that those who pray to the spirit as a Vastudevta after building a structure would be blessed and that the spirit was free to torment and trouble those who did not worship it.</p>\n<p>This legend led to the development of Vastu Shastra which has been around since 6000B.C. or even before it.

Life has been restricted inside the four walls of our home; all those Saturday get-together plans, travel vacations have taken a backseat. Our social life has somewhat gone down to zero, taking a toll on our mental health. In these times of negative energies floating around, while we try to cheer ourselves up, we could also seek solace in our ancient Indian Science of Vastu. Here are some Vastu tips for COVID-19 that can help you regain your sanity in these insane times. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>De-clutter Your Space</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most important Vastu Tips for<strong> <a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/covid-19-may-prod-people-to-buy-new-homes-heres-why\">COVID-19 pandemic</a></strong> is to de-clutter your home. Take out the old stuff and make space for new as it generates positive energy which in turn refreshes your mind and attracts positive vibes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Vastu Tips: Don&#8217;t Underestimate <strong>the Magical Camphor</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever thought of the benefits of burning camphor in the house. This humble solid with a strong aroma is not utilised to its true potential. Camphor has therapeutic properties. You can choose to burn camphor at various corners of your <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/step-inside-mirzapur-actor-ali-faizals-bandra-home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">home</a>. This will neutralise negative energies and create a nice and auspicious environment inside.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Vastu Tips for COVID-19: Light Lamps, Diyas and Incense Sticks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A well-lit home not just pushes away negativity but also amplifies the beautiful interiors. You must always make it a habit to light diyas, lamps, and incense sticks every morning and evening. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"360\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutterstock_1848062101.jpg\" alt=\"Ward off COVID negativity by lighting diyas\" class=\"wp-image-24396\" srcset=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutterstock_1848062101.jpg 360w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutterstock_1848062101-300x217.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Medicines in the Kitchen? A Big No.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have the habit of keeping medicines in the kitchen? You should get rid of that.

This is what meditation is for you. So, start with 15 minutes a day and you will surely become a better person than today.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Say Hello to Wind Chimes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hang wind chimes at the window side or anywhere it&#8217;s airy.

Adhering to the same will usher in greater prosperity for members of any home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wondering about internal staircase Vastu principles and why they are important? The ancient Vastu Shastra guidelines lay equal emphasis on each and every component of the home, laying down basic dos and don\u2019ts in order to optimize well-being, happiness, prosperity and good health. Staircases are a pivotal part of any independent home, apartment building or commercial establishment. In case they are not suitably placed, it may lead to an accumulation of negative energy which may wash away all the accumulated positive vibes of the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Direction and other tenets as per internal staircase Vastu principles</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Internal staircase <a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/money-plant-vastu\">Vastu guidelines</a> clearly state that all such structures should be constructed in a manner where the person climbing the steps moves to the southward direction from the north.
