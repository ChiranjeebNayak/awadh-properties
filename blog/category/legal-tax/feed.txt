<p class="has-text-align-justify">Societies are often stringent about keeping accurate records and paperwork. The managing committees of a housing society have the key responsibility of ensuring that all the proof of sale towards the property is rightfully issued. A<strong>&nbsp;share certificate</strong>, quite like the sale deed is proper proof that the rightful owner of the said property must possess.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Sometimes,&nbsp;<strong>housing society members&nbsp;</strong>tend to overlook or forget to issue these share certificates to the members which can be a problem in case a property-related issue occurs. While the sale deed does act as proof that you are the official owner of the property, a share certificate is legal proof of the same and is indispensable. The managing committee must ensure you have this but in case you do not have one, you can obtain one with ease.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-a-share-certificate"><strong>What is a Share Certificate?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In simple terms, a&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>&nbsp;is a legal document or certification provided by a cooperative&nbsp;<strong>housing society</strong>&nbsp;to the registered owner of the flat. This is given to the member at no cost and ideally, should be given within six months from the time of&nbsp;<strong>allotment of the shares in the housing society&nbsp;</strong>as per the number of shares subscribed by him/her. This share certificate is an active proof of ownership and should have the name of the said housing society, a distinctive number, number of shares allotted to the member as well as value paid after that. The&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>&nbsp;is free, and the registrar then decided the total authorized value at the time the society has been registered. In an event that the member has cleared all his or her dues and no other hitches are existing, the denial of a share certificate can entitle the member to take legal action against the cooperative&nbsp;<strong>housing society</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-why-do-you-need-a-share-certificate"><strong>Why do you need a Share Certificate?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">A&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>&nbsp;is an indispensable document that solely acts as actual legal proof of ownership to the property and the shareholding within the society. The sale deed is also an important document, but the share certificate trumps that in case of official demand. This answer the question of&nbsp;<strong>what is a share certificate and why do you need it</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-a-checklist-for-the-issuance-of-a-share-certificate"><strong>A Checklist for the Issuance of a Share Certificate&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>What to check before/after getting a share certificate&nbsp;</strong>is stated below and should be well kept in mind.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>The&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>&nbsp;must be collected by the member in person himself/herself.&nbsp;</li><li>There should be no dues or penalties on the member&#8217;s property. In case there are any, they should be immediately paid up.&nbsp;</li><li>An important document called the &#8216;conveyance deed&#8217; that is issued by the builder should be in the possession of the&nbsp;<strong>housing society</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>The&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>&nbsp;should be signed by the secretary, chairman, and any other member of the managing committee along with the official seal of the&nbsp;<strong>housing society</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>The share certificate should be authorized by the managing committee first and only then issued by the secretary.&nbsp;</li><li>The housing society will demand that you give an<strong>&nbsp;indemnity bond</strong>&nbsp;which means that under no circumstances should the allotted shares be transferred to any individual or entity for any purpose whatsoever.&nbsp;</li><li>The names on the&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>&nbsp;should be exactly in the same order as it appears on the original sale agreement between the builder and the member. This includes primary as well as associate members.&nbsp;</li><li>The member will need to indemnify the cooperative housing society against any loans and complete any incomplete paperwork before the&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>&nbsp;can be issued.&nbsp;</li><li>No typos or spelling errors should be there in the name and other content on the sale deed. With this you can stay away from any issues that can arrive in future.</li><li>While collecting the&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>, the member will need to present the original sale deed.&nbsp;</li><li>Ensure that after you collect the&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>, all the required signatures as per the society members, official seal, etc. are present on it.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-transferring-of-share-certificate-in-case-of-resale"><strong>Transferring of Share Certificate in Case of Resale</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Certain norms need to be followed in case of a resale. In such a scenario, the original&nbsp;<strong>share certificate&nbsp;</strong>will have to be given to the housing society along with any other documents as needed. In case the share certificate is being transferred in the name of the new member of the housing society after the resale, all procedures about the transfer of the share certificate will need to be made prior to any finalization. The following mentioned points should be kept in mind under such a circumstance.</p>



<ul><li>The new member will need to pay the premium for the transfer of the share certificate.&nbsp;</li><li>The new member will have to make sure that all dues should be cleared by the previous owner of the property.&nbsp;</li><li>The new member will need to produce all the documents and necessary applications required by the&nbsp;<strong>housing society</strong>. These documents and applications should be in mint condition.&nbsp;</li><li>In an event that the original member dies, his or her consequent heirs will have to make an application for the share transfer to the appointed nominee and a new share certificate will have to be obtained.&nbsp;</li><li>The new share certificate should be issued by the cooperative&nbsp;<strong>housing society</strong>&nbsp;within the stipulated time, a lack of which can allow the member to take necessary legal action.</li><li>Readymade&nbsp;<strong>share certificate&nbsp;</strong>booklets are readily available online. Moreover, you can get them at book printing agencies as well as housing federation offices.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-issuance-of-a-duplicate-share-certificate"><strong>Issuance of a Duplicate Share Certificate&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Just as in the case of any important document, it is advisable to keep the original copy of the&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>&nbsp;in a safe place and a proper condition. If you damage or lose this, getting a duplicate is not a simple task. However, it is difficult but not impossible. You can request the&nbsp;<strong>housing society members</strong>&nbsp;to issue you a new one and for this, you will need to follow the steps mentioned below.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Step 1</strong>&nbsp;– The very first thing you will need to do is visit the local police station within your jurisdiction and file an FIR. You will need to add all the details in a registering report that will include details of whether the certificate is lost, damaged, misplaced, stolen, etc. Once this is done, you will need to retain the FIR acknowledgment by the police as you will need it for future communication and reference.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Step 2</strong>&nbsp;– Once the FIR is complete, you will then need to inform the housing society members of this mishap. For this, you will be required to send a written application to them in which you will request them to issue you a new duplicate share certificate. This application will also need to have the details of what happened to the original copy. (i.e whether it is stolen, lost, misplaced, damaged, untraceable, etc.) You will also need to attach the FIR acknowledgment copy that you will have received after filing the FIR. (First Information Report).&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Step 3&nbsp;</strong>– After step 2, you will need to submit an&nbsp;<strong>indemnity bond</strong>&nbsp;of Rs. 200 to the cooperative housing society. This will clear the society of all costs resulting due to the issuance of the new duplicate&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>. All costs that arise for this procedure will have to be borne by the member himself/herself. Make sure that this indemnity bond is officially notarized and attach the FIR acknowledgment copy along with it.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Step 4 –&nbsp;</strong>Once the above-mentioned steps are complete, the managing committee will then review your application along with all the attached paperwork in the next general body meeting in which they will decide whether they want to approve or disapprove your request.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Step 5 –&nbsp;</strong>If your request is approved, the housing society will then display a notice on the main notice board of the society so that all other members can have a look. Additionally, the society will also publish notices in at least two newspapers. All of this will be in regards to the issuing of a duplicate share certificate, the cost of which will need to be paid by the applicant.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Step 6 –&nbsp;</strong>You along with the society will have to wait for a minimum of 15 days to see if any objections are made.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Step 7 –&nbsp;</strong>If everything goes smoothly, and no objections are made, the housing society will then issue a new duplicate share certificate to you which you will have to collect in person when ready.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">So if you have lost or misplaced your original copy and are asking yourself, &#8216;<strong>Can I get a duplicate one?</strong>&#8221; the above-mentioned procedure will help you with the same.  The ownership of a share certificate is extremely important for a property owner in a cooperative housing society. It does not only act as a legal document for your rights but also proves the allotment of shares of that society in your name. Without this share certificate, you can face issues in the future such as transferring the property to the rightful heirs, involvement or rights in any social events, police aid in case of crime, and many other such issues that may occur. Fortunately, even if the<strong> housing society</strong> has forgotten to issue this share certificate to you, you can now get it at any time from them. This article has dotted all the i&#8217;s and cross all the t&#8217;s with its information on the importance of a share certificate. If you have your original copy, ensure you keep it safe and in case you don&#8217;t, go and get it today! </p>

						Unfortunately, the issuance of a duplicate share certificate is not as easy as getting the original one. More often than not, no one objects, but for some reason, if someone has a valid reason to raise one, the matter will then need to be taken up in court. You will need to fight a case for this in that case                    </p>

<p><strong>GIFT DEEDS: A COMPLETE GUIDE</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">All people like to give something to the one they love. Although donations are commonplace, few of us understand the legal implications of this process. The ideal way to donate is to give a <strong>gift deed</strong>. In some cases, the deed will rank above the word ‘Will’. The transfer of property to someone can be paid or given for free. When ownership transfer has nothing to do with currency transactions, this transfer is called a gift deed. The <strong>registration of a gift deed </strong>does not require any financial reward; however, the entire legal process will be followed for acquiring it. A registered deed of gift is also evidence of its own, and, unlike a will, the transfer of ownership is instantaneous, and you do not have to go to court for enforcement, which saves a lot of time and hassle.</p>



<h2 id="h-explanation-of-gift-deeds"><strong>EXPLANATION OF GIFT DEEDS</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Documents to register a gift deed</strong> includes the voluntary transfer of a gift from a donor to a person without a monetary bonus. Such gift transfers must be registered in accordance with the &#8220;Transfer of Property Act&#8221;. It is a means of tax avoidance. It can be transferred to an actual person or institution; the recipient must receive the gift while the donor is alive.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-constitutes-as-a-gift"><strong>WHAT CONSTITUTES AS A GIFT</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">If you <strong>register a gift deed</strong> on file, it will help avert any litigation that may occur later.</p>



<ul><li>It must be either static or immovable.</li><li>It must be an existing property; that is, it must exist in the present and should not be a property to be bought in the future.</li><li>It must be transferable.</li><li>It must be tangible.</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-inclusions-in-a-gift-deed"><strong>INCLUSIONS IN A GIFT DEED</strong></h2>



<ul><li>The date and place of the issuance of the document.</li><li>Information about the donor, such as name, address, date of birth, father&#8217;s name.</li><li>Details of the giver like name, father&#8217;s name, address, and relationship with the donor.</li><li>Signatures of the donor and the recipient and the signatures of the witnesses (two witnesses) present at the time of the handover.</li><li>Photographs of the witness, donee, and donor.</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-process-of-making-a-gift-deed"><strong>PROCESS OF MAKING A GIFT DEED</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Drafting the first step &#8211; The <strong>gift deed</strong> can be drafted by a lawyer who will enunciate what will be transferred and to whom. A deed is an agreement between the giver, that is, an agreement between the giver and the recipient. Also, it can be said that it&#8217;s a reciprocal act of giving and receiving at the same time. For the gift to be effective, it must be offered voluntarily by the person, and no coercion or exchange of money is allowed.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Accepting the gift &#8211; Acceptance is also an important legal requirement for a valid gift. Once the gift is sent, the recipient must accept the gift for life. Otherwise, the gift will be invalid. The validity of acceptance can be determined through acts such as possession.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Registering the gift &#8211; Unless registered, recipients of real estate gifts cannot obtain ownership of such gifts.

<p class="has-text-align-justify">From a legal point of view, the owner of the property can give gifts to others. An exception to this rule is that the donor or recipient is a minor. Minors are not allowed to sign contracts; therefore, they cannot give up their property. If the donor is a minor, the donation has no legal effect.

When the recipient grows up, he/she will either accept the encumbrance or return the gift.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-a-verbal-real-estate-gift-legal"><em>Is a verbal real estate gift legal?</em></h2>

<h2 id="h-charges-for-a-gift-deed-registration"><strong>CHARGES FOR A GIFT DEED REGISTRATION</strong></h2>

<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>State</strong></td><td><strong>Stamp Duty</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Delhi</td><td>Men: 6% Women: 4%</td></tr><tr><td>Maharashtra</td><td>Agricultural land/ residential property:&nbsp;&nbsp; INR 200 Family members: 3% Other relatives: 5% &nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Gujarat</td><td>4.9% of the market value</td></tr><tr><td>Punjab</td><td>Family members: NIL Non-family members: 6%</td></tr><tr><td>Karnataka</td><td>Family members: INR 1,000- 5,000 Non-family members: 5.6% of the land value</td></tr><tr><td>Tamil Nadu</td><td>Family members: 1% Non-family: 7%</td></tr><tr><td>Rajasthan</td><td>Men: 5% Women: 4% and 3% Immediate family: 2.5% For spouse: 1% Widow: None SC/ST or BPL: 3% &nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>West Bengal</td><td>Family members: 0.5% Non-family members: 6% More than Rs 40 lakh: Surcharge of 1%</td></tr><tr><td>Uttar Pradesh</td><td>Men: 7% Women: 6%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-gift-deeds-and-tax-implication"><strong>GIFT DEEDS AND TAX IMPLICATION</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Gift Deeds</strong> must be reported on an income tax return (ITR). In 1998, the Gift Tax Act of 1958 was repealed, but it came into force again in 2004. If the amount of stamp duty exceeds INR 50,000 and the property received does not obtain the required allowance, the tax implication would be enormous. For example, the tax rebate is INR 1.5 Lakhs, and the stamp duty is INR 4 lakhs, then the penultimate difference between is more than INR 50,000.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-revoke-a-gift-deed"><strong>HOW TO REVOKE A GIFT DEED</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">According to Article 126 of the &#8220;Transfer of Property Act&#8221;, the gift contract can be revoked if the following conditions are met:</p>



<ul><li>The donor and the recipient agree to cancel the donation.</li><li>The transfer of ownership is based only on the wishes of the one who transfers the said gift deed, and the receiver is unwilling to accept the assets.</li><li>For property created as part of a gift, this situation is not illegal or immoral. This means that the gift is not fraudulent. However, legal counsel should be sought to clear the underlying process.</li><li>Remember, once the gift contract is ready, it cannot be revoked unless a revocation clause is added. Be sure to add an &#8220;exit clause&#8221; to avoid complications in the future.</li></ul>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>CAN A GIFT DEED BE ALLOWED TO REGISTER IN A PERSON’S PRIVATE RESIDENCE</strong></p>



<p>According to Article 31 of the Registration Act, it herein allows the registrar to visit the apartment or home of a person who wants to submit a <strong>gift deed certificate</strong> as evidence of a special reason (such as a physical disability). To register and accept this type of deed, the person in charge of the record must be convinced that the specific reasons provided are sufficient.</p>



<h2 id="h-relinquishment-deeds-and-gift-deeds"><strong>RELINQUISHMENT DEEDS AND GIFT DEEDS</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Relinquishment deeds and gifts are different types of property transfer in the eyes of the law. The act of transfer enables a person to vacate or transfer their legal ownership of the property. However, in the deed of relinquishment, the transferred property is always hereditary, and the gifted asset is not necessarily hereditary. The person to whom the property is relinquished must be the co-owner of the property. In the case of a gifted property, anyone can do so by giving explicit favour to the property itself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-justify">“Invest in real estate today, hold it for a few years, and then sell it for a profit.” This has long been the motto for investors seeking safe, low-risk, and low-volatility assets.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">When selling properties such as land, apartments, villas, flats, bungalows, etc. the owner nearly always makes a profit. This is especially true if the owner has owned the property for a long time. According to Indian tax rules, the profit earned is considered income, and the income-earner is responsible for paying taxes on it. While this is necessary, under different sections of the Income Tax Act, such sellers are entitled to specific exclusions from their tax liability.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The Income Tax Act, for instance, exempts long-term capital gains from taxation if they are invested in the acquisition or building of a residential property under two different sections, Section 54, and Section 54F. Many times, the question of whether a taxpayer can claim exemptions under both provisions if the investment is made in the same residential dwelling has been litigated.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-capital-gains"><strong>What are capital gains?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">When you sell an asset and make a profit, this is referred to as capital gains. The difference between the selling and buying price of an item is known as capital gains. Capital loss, on the other hand, occurs when you sell an item for less than the amount you paid for it. Because the gain or profit is classified as &#8220;income&#8221; under Indian Income Tax Regulations, the person who benefits from the sale must pay tax on the profit amount.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-capital-gains-account-scheme"><strong>What is the Capital Gains Account Scheme?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">If the asset is sold in Plan Year and the seller intends to buy a new house property before the time limit of 2 years or 3 years, the assesses must deposit the gains in the capital gains account scheme (in any branch of the public sector or bank) before the deadline for filing income tax returns.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">While claiming the deduction, the money previously spent on purchase/construction, as well as the amount put in the capital gains account plan, can be claimed as a cost.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">However, if the money put in the Capital Gains Account Scheme is not used within the time restriction, it will be considered income for the prior year in which the three-year period has expired (from the date of transfer of the original asset).</p>



<h2 id="h-section-54-of-the-income-tax-act"><strong>Section 54 of the Income Tax Act</strong></h2>



<p>To qualify for the tax exemption under section 54, the taxpayer must meet the following requirements:</p>



<p>• Individuals or Hindu Undivided Families (HUF) should be the taxpayers. Industries and corporations are not eligible for Section 54 tax advantages.</p>



<p>• It should be a residential property that is sold. Furthermore, the seller should acquire a new residential property one year before the transfer of the old property or two years following the transfer of the old property. If the seller is building a house instead of buying one, he or she must ensure that the new property&#8217;s construction is finished within three years of the sale/transfer date.</p>



<p>• It is recommended that the new residential property be acquired in India. If the bought property is located outside of India, the seller will not be entitled to any tax benefits.</p>



<h2 id="h-section-54f-of-the-income-tax-act"><strong>Section 54F of the Income Tax Act</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Taxpayers can get a tax reduction if they reinvest the net proceeds from the sale of a capital asset, according to Section 54F of the Income Tax Act. It should be emphasized that the capital asset sold under Section 54F should not be a residential property. Reinvestment in the acquisition or building of a residential property, however, is required to be eligible to claim exemption.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The means of capital gain is the main distinction between Section 54 and Section 54F of the Income Tax Act. If the capital gain is from the sale of a residential property, the exemption is under Section 54; alternatively, it is under Section 54F. Capital gains from the sale of assets such as bonds, shares, land, gold, and so forth may be subject to Section 54F.</p>



<h2 id="h-common-criteria-between-the-two-provisions"><strong>Common criteria between the two provisions</strong></h2>



<p>There are some parallels between the sections as well. If you invest in the acquisition or construction of residential property in India, you may take advantage of both of these sections.</p>



<p>• To be eligible for the exemption, a new residential house property must be acquired or built.</p>



<p>• The new residential property must be acquired one year before or two years after the property/asset is sold.</p>



<p>• Alternatively, for the construction of a house, both provisions demand completion of construction within three years after the asset&#8217;s selling date, regardless of when the work begins.</p>



<p>• If you are unable to invest the required amount in the way described above before the tax filing deadline or one year from the date of sale, deposit the specified amount.</p>



<p>• There are two separate sections, tax officials believe that in order to claim simultaneous investments, you must invest in two different residences and cannot claim the exemption if you just invest in one. The Hyderabad Tax Tribunal was able to address this issue.</p>



<h2 id="h-section-54-v-s-section-54f"><strong>Section 54 v/s Section 54F</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Section 54</strong></td><td><strong>Section 54F</strong></td></tr><tr><td>If you are looking to claim full exemption, you must invest the entire capital gains.</td><td>To claim full exemption, all sale receipts should be invested.</td></tr><tr><td>If the entire capital gain is not invested, the uninvested portion is taxed as long-term capital gains.</td><td>If the entire sale proceeds are not invested, a proportional exemption is granted. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>During the sale of the original asset, one should not own more than 1 residential property.</td></tr><tr><td>If you sell this new property within three years of acquisition, the exemption will be revoked, and capital gains on the sale will be taxed as short-term capital gains.</td><td>If you sell this new property within three years of its acquisition or construction. Or if you buy another residential property within two years of the sale of the original asset or construct a residential property other than the new house within three years of the sale of the original asset, this exemption will be revoked. The sale&#8217;s capital gains will be taxed as long-term capital gains.</td></tr><tr><td>A once-in-a-lifetime exemption is provided for investing in two properties providing capital gains.</td><td>No such exemption is available.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-maximum-amount-of-exemption-permitted-under-section-54-of-the-income-tax-act"><strong>What is the maximum amount of exemption permitted under Section 54 of the Income Tax Act?</strong></h2>



<p>The amount of the long-term capital gains tax exemption under Section 54 of the Income Tax Act will be the lesser of:</p>



<ul><li>Long-term capital gains on the sale of a primary residence, or</li></ul>



<ul><li>The amount of money spent on the acquisition or building of a new residential home. As a result, any remaining capital gains (if any) will be taxed.</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-to-give-you-an-example"><strong>To give you an example:</strong></h3>



<p>John sells his villa (home) for ₹45,00,000/-.</p>



<p>He buys another villa for ₹20,00,000/- using the profits of the sale.</p>



<p>The following is how capital gains will be calculated:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Particulars</strong></td><td><strong>Amount (INR)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Capital gain on the sale of a residential property</td><td>45,00,000</td></tr><tr><td>Less: Invested in residential house property</td><td>20,00,000</td></tr><tr><td>Balance – Capital Gains</td><td>25,00,000</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The exemption will be the lesser of ₹45,00,000 in capital gains or ₹20,00,000 in new property investment, therefore the exemption will be ₹20,00,000.</p>



<h2 id="h-venkata-ramana-umareddy"><strong>VENKATA RAMANA UMAREDDY</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The assessee received long-term capital gain (LTCG) from the transfer of two different and independent assets — one a piece of land and the other a residential property – during the relevant financial year. He argued that because the whole LTCG from the sale of the two properties was invested in the acquisition of the new residential property, he was eligible for&nbsp;the exemptions provided by sections 54 and 54F. The Assessing Officer denied the application, stating that the assessee required to invest in two dwellings in order to claim an exemption under sections 54 and 54F. The CIT(A) also affirmed the AO&#8217;s decision. The current appeal was submitted by an aggrieved assessee.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-tribunal-ruled-in-the-assessee-s-favour-as-follows"><strong>The Tribunal ruled in the assessee&#8217;s favour, as follows:</strong></h2>



<p>• Sections 54 and 54F function separately and apply to LTCG deriving from the transfer of distinct and separate long-term capital assets. But only the acquisition or building of a new residential dwelling is exempt under both provisions.</p>



<ul><li>The lower authorities&#8217; sole rationale for rejecting the assessee&#8217;s claim of exemption under section 54 was that the assessee could not claim an exemption under both provisions for the same dwelling. As per the lower authorities, the assessee had to invest in two residences in order to claim an exemption under sections 54 and 54F. Such a reading of the regulations was completely erroneous and out of place.</li></ul>



<p>• There was also no specific prohibition in either section 54 or 54F of the Act preventing the issuance of an exemption under both sections provided by the provisions&#8217; criteria.</p>



<p>• The assessee was eligible to claim an exemption under sections 54 and 54F because the long-term capital gain emerged from the sale of two different and independent assets, namely, a residential house and a plot of land, and he had invested the entire capital gain in the purchase of a new residential property.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-justify">A <strong>will</strong> is a statement of legal intent that a person wants to make after death, and after the <strong>testator </strong>makes the will, it can only be revoked during his lifetime. A copy of the will be affixed with a court seal of jurisdiction to transfer the estate management rights of the <strong>testator</strong>; inheritance can only be transferred to the executor specified in the <strong>will </strong>to the <strong>legal heir</strong>. In law, this Caveat can be declared as a warning or a preventive measure (usually in <strong>probate</strong> cases) without considering a certain issue. The solution is: if it is not approved, do not listen to the non-issued order and file a disclaimer. This can be done on an application that has already been submitted, or it can be done in the future. According to the <strong>Indian Succession Act of 1925</strong>, <strong>probate</strong> is defined as follows: probate refers to a copy of the will with the seal of a court of jurisdiction and transfer of the <strong>testator&#8217;s </strong>estate management rights. The person who made the will has shown an interest in their wishes to be executed by certain people who are usually mentioned as executors after his death. The probate determines the authenticity of the will and finally proves the authenticity as well. Probate is conclusive evidence of the legal execution of a will, and it is the true and final will of the deceased.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-it-work"><strong>HOW DOES IT WORK?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Probate</strong> is the analysis and management of the transfer of assets that previously belonged to the deceased. When the owner dies, their property is usually reviewed by the succession court. The probate process usually first analyzes whether the deceased has made a <strong>will</strong> that is legalized; in many cases, the deceased has drafted documents that include instructions on how to distribute the property after death; however, in some cases, the deceased will not leave a will.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-a-probate-with-a-legal-will"><strong>WHAT IS A PROBATE WITH A LEGAL WILL?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The deceased who created the <strong>will</strong> is called the <strong>testator</strong>. After the <strong>testator</strong> dies, the executor is responsible for initiating the probate procedure. The contractor is usually a financial consultant. The executor is responsible for depositing the will in the <strong>probate court</strong>. States may have different rules on how long a will must be filed after death. Submitting for inheritance will start the inheritance process. A will is a process of judicial control. Firstly, it is necessary to confirm the will&#8217;s authenticity and make it valid and accepted as the true last will of the deceased; then, the court officially appoints the executor specified in the will, and the executor gets authorized to act on behalf of the deceased.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-it-necessary"><strong>WHY IS IT NECESSARY?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The public does not know under what circumstances a will is binding. According to the <strong>Indian Succession Act of 1925</strong>, a will is mandatory if it is made under the control of the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal and may be within the local limits of the original civil jurisdiction customary to the High Courts of Madras and Mumbai Judiciary. These provisions refer to places known in India when the 1925 Inheritance Act was promulgated. Today, this refers to the metropolises of West Bengal, Chennai, and Mumbai. If the will was drafted by Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, or Buddhists, then the mandatory rules of testament above apply. Interestingly, if the will is within the geographic range of these locations, the will is binding, even if the will does not apply to real estate.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Therefore, if you do not meet any of these three conditions, you do not need a will; however, even if you do not, there is no legal restriction on obtaining a will. If the validity of the will in the future may be questioned for any reason. Many housing companies do not insist on probate when transferring apartments on behalf of the decedent of the apartment. For example, as an office located in the above three regions, a housing company or the authority responsible for the registration of the owner&#8217;s details might need the absolution of probate, which will be used for the transfer of property.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-a-probate-without-a-will"><strong>WHAT IS A PROBATE WITHOUT A WILL?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">If a person dies without a will, then they are considered to have died without a will. An intestate estate is also a will that is submitted to the court and is declared invalid. The probate procedure involves the distribution of the deceased’s property in accordance with national laws. If the deceased has no assets, there is no need for a will. Generally, the succession process begins with the appointment of an administrator to supervise the property of the deceased. The administrator can also resolve outstanding claims. The trustee is responsible for determining the <strong>legal heirs</strong> of the deceased, including the surviving spouse, children, and parents. The probate court will determine what property is divided among the <strong>legal heirs</strong> and how the inheritance laws of most states divide the estate between the surviving spouse and the children of the deceased.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-apply-for-a-probate"><strong>HOW TO APPLY FOR A PROBATE</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">An executor must appeal to the court for the probate. The executor must attach the original will along with the application. In the application, the executor must provide the name and address of the <strong>legal heir of the testator</strong> before notice. The court will require the plaintiff to prove the death of the testator, which is done with a death certificate given by the local authority. The executor must also prove that the will submitted to the court is the deceased&#8217;s last will; the applicant must also prove the submitted will is legally executed.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-are-eligible-for-a-probate"><strong>WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR A PROBATE</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The executor must send an application to the court for the will; the executor must attach the original will to the application; must also indicate the name and address of the legal heir of the deceased in the application so that they can be notified before the will is approved. The court usually requires the plaintiff to provide evidence of the death of the testator, which is done with the help of a death certificate issued by the local authority. The executor is also obliged to prove that the will submitted to the court is the last will of the testator and to prove to the applicant that the will is legally executed by the testator.</p>



<h2 id="h-challenges-to-a-probate"><strong>CHALLENGES TO A PROBATE</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Refuting a will can be quite intimidating. In most cases, the court strictly abides by the will because the testator no longer exists for defense; however, if you are interested in the will, you can object to it, and if you can persuade the court, you can revoke it in whole or in a part will. You must consult a lawyer before questioning a will because the right to avoid a will is complicated, and each case is unusual.</p>



<ul><li><em><strong>Lack of enforcement:</strong></em></li></ul>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">A valid will must be signed and written by the testator in the presence of two witnesses. They must also confirm the will; if the procedures are not strictly followed, the will can be challenged in court as per law.</p>



<ul><li><em><strong>Lack of testamentary capacity:</strong></em></li></ul>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The law stipulates that people over 18 years of age can make a will. It is assumed that adults have legal capacity so that they can challenge the will for reasons such as old age, insanity, and senility. Other factors include that the testator is affected by a certain substance or mentally incapable of creating a will. In principle, to challenge the will based on intelligence, the opponent of the will does not have to know the consequences of making the will in the first place.</p>



<ul><li><em><strong>Improper influence:</strong></em></li></ul>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The estate applicant can challenge the will by proving that the will was obtained through fraud, forgery, or undue influence.</p>



<ul><li><em><strong>The dearth of approval:</strong></em></li></ul>



<p>A will challenger may claim that the testator did not know the contents of the will when he signed it initially.</p>



<ul><li><em><strong>Family complaints</strong></em></li></ul>



<p>&nbsp;Family members can object to the will because there is no inclusion of them recorded in the will.</p>



<ul><li><em><strong>Revocation of a previous will</strong></em></li></ul>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The revocation of an earlier will, even if it is registered, can be challenged in court. Registration of the will (not required by law to register the will) alone is not enough to dispel all suspicions about a registered will, as a registered will cannot be the last will. A new will, even if it is not registered, takes precedence over the registered will. In the event of suspicion, the court examines the will, even if it is registered.</p>



<h2 id="h-judicial-process-for-a-probate"><strong>JUDICIAL PROCESS FOR A PROBATE</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">After submitting the application, it is checked, and the legal heir of the deceased is then informed that the court has received the inheritance application. To object to the granting of the inheritance, a notice can also be issued. If the court does not object, the succession will be waived. If the court receives objections to the probate issue, the application becomes a probate judgment.</p>



<h2 id="h-probate-costs"><strong>PROBATE COSTS</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Since the estate is awarded by a higher court, you must pay a court fee based on the property&#8217;s value in question. Court fees are varied, and each is set according to the state. It is 2% to 7.5% from Maharashtra, depending on the plates, subject to a maximum of INR 75,000. In addition to the court fees, you will also have to pay legal fees.</p>



<h2 id="h-location-of-the-assets-of-the-deceased"><strong>LOCATION OF THE ASSETS OF THE DECEASED</strong></h2>



<ul><li>First, the executor is to find and possess all the deceased&#8217;s assets to protect them during the probate process. Some people have assets that have not been disclosed to anyone (including their spouse), and these assets may not appear in their will.</li></ul>



<ul><li>As far as real estate is involved, the executor should not move into an apartment or building and stay there throughout the probate process to &#8220;protect&#8221; it. However, you need to make sure that you have paid property taxes, insurance is up to date, and all mortgages avoid foreclosure and property loss.</li></ul>



<ul><li>However, beneficiaries can own other assets, such as collectibles or even cars, by keeping them in a safe place. Other places to check will be bank and investment accounts as well as stocks and bonds.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>SETTLEMENT OF THE DEBTS</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The executor will use the estate to settle all debts and final accounts of the testator, including those incurred during the last illness.</p>



<h2><strong>TAX RETURNS READYING AND SUBSEQUENT FILING</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The executor files the final income tax return of the testator for the year of death. It is then determined whether the estate is subject to inheritance tax and, if so, file those tax returns as well. You will also be paid with inheritance funds. This can sometimes involve liquidating assets to raise money. Inheritance taxes are generally due within nine months of the deceased&#8217;s death.</p>



<h2><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Endeavouring to make the will is a time-consuming task that the executor has to perform. The testator has to spend money and time paying court fees depending on the value of the inherited property. Still, by virtue of the will, as mentioned above, it is only in certain cases compulsory to apply for the will, while in other cases, it is not necessary to apply for the will.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">When a buyer pays a number of taxes while buying a commercial property, tax liabilities will ultimately increase for the seller as well. Besides capital gains tax, it is likewise liable for the seller to pay the tax deducted at source or TDS during the sale.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-exactly-is-tds">What exactly is TDS?</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The idea of tax deducted at source had been introduced with the objective of collecting tax from the same income source. According to this concept, a deductor or individual liable for paying any particular tax to another individual (deductee) shall be deducting tax at the source and remitting it into the central government&#8217;s account. The deductor will be entitled to receive a credit of the sum which has been deducted based on a TDS certificate produced by the deductor.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Interestingly, the responsibility of deducting the TDS amount and submitting it to the government does not lie on the seller but the buyer. If they cannot discharge this responsibility, they have to pay the penalty in the long run.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In order to verify the rampant usage of unaccounted cash in transactions of immovable property, a law has been introduced by the government of India; wherein, the buyer of the property needs to deduct the tax at the source.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-is-accountable-for-deducting-tax-u-s-194ia">Who is accountable for deducting tax u/s 194IA?</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Any individual, being a transferee accountable for paying any sum to a resident transferor by consideration for the transfer of an immovable property (apart from agricultural land), is accountable for deducting tax under this particular section.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Consequently, in case the immovable property has been bought for any particular value from any non-resident person, no TDS will be needed to be deducted whatsoever. Nevertheless, TDS is going to be deducted under Section 195.</p>



<h2 id="h-properties-that-are-covered">Properties that are covered</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Section 194IA of the Income Tax Act reads that an individual, being a transferee, accountable for paying any sum to a resident transferor by way of consideration, for transferring any immovable property (apart from agricultural land)- the amount will be deducted which is equal to 1% of such amount as income tax at the time of credit of such amount to the transferor&#8217;s account or while paying such amount in cash or by the issue of a draft or cheque or any other mode, whichever happens, to be earlier. This particular section needs a purchaser to deduct tax at a 1% rate of the sale consideration if the transaction&#8217;s value happens to be ₹50 lakhs or even more. The section is going to cover commercial property, residential property in addition to land. Nevertheless, transactions relating to the purchase of agricultural land will not be covered under this particular provision.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Moreover, the treatment of properties that any NRI is marketing will be different given that the capital gains tax will also be deducted by the government from NRIs together with the TDS. For this reason, the rate of TDS is going to be much higher in these cases.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-the-tds-should-be-deducted-and-how-should-it-be-paid">When the TDS should be deducted, and how should it be paid?</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">It is imperative for the property’s purchaser to deduct the TDS while executing the conveyance deed or while paying advance in the event of any advance being paid before the conveyance deed is executed. The TDS amount has to be deposited by the purchaser to the central government’s credit within a period of 30 days from the conclusion of the month during which the tax is deducted. For paying the TDS and furnishing other particulars, it is essential to fill in Form 26Qb. Separate Form 26QB has to be filled in for every single set of seller and buyer in case the property has in excess of 1 buyer or seller. Therefore, one has to submit the particulars of every single buyer and seller in each Form 26QB.</p>



<h2 id="h-threshold-limit-u-s-194ia">Threshold Limit u/s 194IA</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">No tax will be deductible, in case the consideration payable or paid for transferring an immovable property happens to be less than ₹50, 00,000.</p>



<h2 id="h-tds-rate-under-section-194ia">TDS rate under Section 194IA</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Tax is going to be deducted at a 1% rate. No Health &amp; Education Cess and surcharge is going to be included in the above rates. Consequently, tax is going to be deducted at the basic rate at the source. The TDS rate is going to be 20% in every single case, in case PAN isn’t quoted.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-bank-lender-will-finance-immovable-property-partly">The bank/lender will finance immovable property partly</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In case the bank/lender partly finances the immovable property. It will be indispensable to deduct TDS on the entire consideration amount by the transferee irrespective of the financing amount. According to section 194IA, an individual, being a transferee, will be accountable for deducting tax at the source. Once any loan is obtained from the bank, the bank cannot be considered a transferee even though it might provide funds to the purchaser. Consequently, the buyer will deduct the entire TDS from the sum paid by him to the seller, while the bank will not be accountable for deducting TDS on payment done by him on behalf of the buyer.</p>



<h2 id="h-illustration">Illustration</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Suppose an immovable property worth ₹ 60 lakh has been purchased by Y, and ₹ 40 lakhs has been financed with the bank while the remaining has been contributed by him. The TDS to be deducted and deposited by Mr. Y happens to be ₹ 60,000/- (₹ 60 lakhs @ 1%). Therefore, ₹ 40 lakhs will be paid by the bank to the transferor, and Mr. Y is going to pay ₹ 19.40 lakhs. If the payment is made in installments, the amount will be deductible in proportion to the installment paid.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">While a Flat was allotted by the builder, the consideration consists of payment for Permanent Membership of Club, Car Parking, Electricity meter and line laying charges as well as other incidental charges.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">TDS will be applicable on all these payments since these are part of the condition and consideration for the transfer of immovable property. Nevertheless, in case any refundable deposit is made for the maintenance of the club/flat as well as other amenities, these will not be considered for TDS.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">A residential house property was purchased by Mr. A for ₹ 2 crores, and this consisted of the subsequent consideration:</p>



<ol><li>Towards vehicle parking: ₹ 20 lakhs</li><li>Towards purchasing immovable property: ₹ 160 lakhs</li><li>Towards electricity and water facility: ₹ 20 lakhs</li></ol>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">If payment is made before or on 30 June 2019, the tax will be deducted by Mr. X at a 1% rate of ₹ 160 lakhs, equal to ₹ 1, 60,000. If the payment is made on or after 1 September 2019, the tax will be deducted on a total consideration of ₹ 2, 00,000.</p>



<h2 id="h-particulars-needed-for-paying-the-tds">Particulars needed for paying the TDS</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">In general, a tax deduction account number (TAN) has to be obtained by every single individual who is accountable for deducting TDS. Nevertheless, the buyer doesn&#8217;t need to obtain the tax deduction account number in the event of TDS on any property which is immovable. It is essential for you to provide particulars such as the name, address, mobile number, PAN, and email ID of the buyer and the seller in Form 26QB. It is likewise important to provide the property&#8217;s complete address together with the total value of consideration, date of the agreement, date of payment, and so on.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The buyer has to make sure that the seller’s PAN is correct. Or else, it will not be possible for the seller to obtain the credit for tax which the buyer has deducted since the credit is going to flow according to the PAN card particulars furnished in Form 26QB.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">It is possible to pay the TDS online, or it can also be deposited offline. For this, the physical challenge has to be tendered to an authorized bank that will be updating the particulars on the income tax department&#8217;s website. After depositing the TDS, the TDS certificate has to be downloaded by the buyer in Form No 16B from the Income Tax Department website, and it is to be furnished within 15 days to the seller.</p>



<h2 id="h-nil-deduction-or-lower-deduction-of-tds">Nil deduction or lower deduction of TDS</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Some TDS provisions allowed the payee to furnish a nil TDS declaration. He can also approach the IT officer for issuing a certificate such that the payer will be able to deduct tax at a nil rate or a lower rate. Nevertheless, no such TDS provision is applicable on immovable property. The buyer must deduct tax mandatorily at source, where the consideration is going to be more than ₹50 lakhs, in respect of every single set of seller and buyer.</p>



<h2 id="h-consequences-in-case-tds-is-not-paid">Consequences in case TDS is not paid</h2>

If the buyers cannot pay the TDS within the specified time period to the government, they might be required to pay the penalty in the form of interest, or they might likewise be sentenced to laborious imprisonment of as much as 7 years. It is important to keep in mind that although the seller might be compelled to make the payment, the buyer and none else would face the penalty.</p>

That is all we aim to fulfill by the end of this blog post.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Building tax differentiated from other similar concepts </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Terms such as building tax, property tax, the land tax might appear similar to you, but is it so? The context in which such terminologies are used in India makes them different from one another. Property tax is a simpler concept, and it resembles the annual tax paid to the local authority within whose jurisdiction your property lies. On the other hand, land tax is the tax paid owing to ownership of bare real estate property.&nbsp; However, the implication and context of building tax are completely separated from the others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Building tax is calculated on your annual income, from which the tax gets deducted depending on the category of income your earnings fall under. As an owner of a property, if or not you are entitled to any profits out of it, you need to part with the government as its revenue. That is exactly what is termed as income tax on house property. The mere existence of ownership of a property and its benefits entitles you to pay taxes as responsible citizens.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What are the different categories of buildings for which tax can be charged?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are primarily three types of usages of a building. It can either be a residential building, a commercial building, or a building used for institutional purposes. Each category has a different capability to generate revenue which further interferes with the amount of tax you need to pay. Besides, there lies about other multiple subheads under which category a particular building might fall. Depending on these factors, building tax is often accounted for. It is mostly the residential building paying the least taxes and the commercial buildings paying the most taxes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Modes of calculating building tax</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The civic bodies scattered in different parts of India usually opt for three typical modes of calculating taxes. Let’s take a look at how the procedure is conducted:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Capital value system (CVS):</strong> It is perhaps the simplest mode of calculations fixed by the government itself. Under this system, the market value of the property is the key consideration. Such market value differs as you move from one location to the other. Based on the locality, such value is determined by the government. Mumbai is one such city that has adopted such a valuation method.</li>
<li><strong>Unit area value system (UAVS):</strong> The name in itself suggests a rough picture for the audience. Under the UAV system, the carpet area of the land is a considerable factor. The value per Sq. Ft area is multiplied by the total area of the land that the building is constructed on. States such as Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Delhi, Bengaluru, Patna follow this method of valuation. The unit per area system takes into consideration the position, construction type, and the type of building. These categories play an influential role in determining the per Sq. Ft value of the land in consideration.</li>
<li><strong>Annual rental value system (ARVS):</strong> Under this system of valuation, it is the presumptive rental capabilities of a property in a year, taking into consideration. The municipal corporation of the jurisdiction determines such a rate based on certain factors that contribute to the rent generating capabilities of the property.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are the various methods that help the civic bodies adjudge taxes for each building. However, there are other equally important factors to be taken into consideration. Some of those factors include locality, market value, proximity to important destinations, etc. All such factors make up for the tax amount you are obligated to pay.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conditions that exempt tax pay on buildings </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In India, the provisions for exemption of tax are enjoyed by several categories of buildings that serve the welfare of the country. In a country where the public good is of utmost consideration, such features are often noted. Therefore, here are some examples of the building that enjoy tax exemption: spaces meant for religious purposes, educational establishments, charitable institutions, ancient/historical monuments, burial/cremation grounds, government land/buildings set out for recreational purposes, trade union association offices, buildings/ lands of urban development authorities established in each state and their acts, establishments providing free medical aid/education and certain specific vacant land/ buildings, belongings of war widows and high-importance award winners, properties of foreign embassies and central government, including the residences of significant bureaucrats and politicians.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Penalty/consequence for non-payment </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Different cities or municipalities have diverse methods of <strong>building tax </strong>collection. However, with the ever-growing issues of illegal constructions, there is a lack of revenue that reaches the government. India has a vast lower income group population, and that perhaps is the reason behind such illegal construction, thus leading to a scarcity of funds for the government. Nevertheless, gone are the days when strict actions and penalties were not charged on people willing to avoid legit tax pay.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lately, the authorities in different states have enacted different methods to deal with repeated offenders. In the initial stage of non-payment, the authorities order cuts on essential connections such as electricity, water, broadband, etc. Depending on the intensity of the case, some might even be entitled to legal constraints for nonpayment. Cities such as Noida and Gurgaon are perfect examples to support such penalty claims. In these cities, properties of long-term defaulters are confiscated as a consequence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Property law base in India: Its status </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In India, property tax lies in several folds of categories. The word property has its classifications. It is not just land considered to be property; any improvements made to a particular piece of land falls under the category of a property. Likewise, the government mandates the payment of such a category of taxes. The valuation of such property is bestowed on the local civic body under the jurisdiction of the region. It is primarily the municipal corporations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The payment of such taxes is carried out either annually or semi-annually, depending on each region. It is an excellent source of revenue for the government to build up the local amenities for the public good. From expenses on road repairs to maintenance of public places like parks, hospitals, etc., are undertaken by the government based on these taxes. The tax payable is differently applied in different places, and it all depends on the location, connection with amenities, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Can tax be charged on vacant spaces?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In India, there are no particular norms to entitle a house owner to pay <strong>vacant building tax. </strong>However, when it comes down to <strong>property tax, </strong>there is no consideration of whether you have a construction or not. Every landowner is annually entitled to pay such <strong>property tax. </strong>But, over the past few decades, there has been a change in perceiving the high-value resources. Several states have adopted the system of charging <strong>vacant land tax. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">States such as Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and even the Union Territory of Delhi fall under the purview of such a newly implemented scheme. The principle behind such implementation is to preserve wasting resources that are of high value to the nation. In the state of Tamil Nadu, the valuation of <strong>vacant land tax </strong>is calculated on the basis of per Sq. Ft area and its proximity to important areas. Likewise, different implementing states have their recourse in calculating the tax valuation of a vacant property.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Likewise, in Hyderabad, the state legislature is such that any vacant land which is not used for agricultural, or occupation purposes will have to pay a tax. The amount of tax payable is about 0.05% of the total valuation of the plot. There is variation when we move to Punjab. In Punjab, too, the state legislations were amended, and taxes were levied on unproductive spaces. It is chargeable at 0.2% of the yearly valuation of the property.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Online payment basics of building tax </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 21<sup>st</sup> century calls for easy access to the internet. Similarly, today, one can choose to opt for online payment of taxes. Municipal corporations enable property taxpayers to avail themselves of the online mode of payment. Almost all megacities, along with certain comparatively smaller cities, have opted for online mode of payment through debit/credit card or even net banking. Once you enroll yourself with the official portal, you are all good to go. However, for the registration procedure, one needs to put in both personal and property details.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Post-registration, all you need to do is provide some identification details and relevant documents to initiate the payment. One can make payment via the prescribed modes and acquire a challan printout for future reference.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Owning a property ensures payment of taxes as per the prescription of the legislation. However, a <strong><a href="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/property-tax-delhi">property tax</a> rebate in India </strong>can be allowed when the intention behind acquiring the property is public good and welfare. Non-payment, too, can lead to a situation that is not likely suited for most. Hence, as responsible citizens, it is part of our responsibility to fulfill the mandated legal norms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, the government&#8217;s expenses are run from the payment made by taxpayers, and a compromise on that would lead to malfunction. Thus, ensuring the complete safety of your land and property in the public records is a must. And paying <strong>building tax </strong>gives you the liberty to enjoy your property holding at its best forms.</p>

<p>Mutating an estate or a plot is a compulsory method in all official proceedings including the property. Change in title/ownership becomes necessary for determining the tax liability at the time of the equity ownership getting changed. By the mutation of land, an individual can get the justice of the land. To bypass the dispute over the title of the land, the change in ownership name is performed by each of the parties that are the buyer as well as the seller.</p>



<p>A mutation requires to be transferred in all matters of estate title alterations such as replacing or buying of assets, the loss of the estate owner, and also a possession made through control of the Attorney. By performing the mutation procedure, the new owner obtains the title of the assets listed in their name in the property revenue department and allows the Government to impose a property tax. Mutation becomes necessary for determining the tax obligation when the estate proprietor is changed.</p>



<h2><strong>Land Mutation in Bihar</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/property-mutation-everything-you-need-to-know">Mutatio</a>n of capital is the modification or change of ownership/title from an individual to another when the estate is sold or assigned to some other person. By mutating an estate, the latest owner receives the ownership of the property listed in his or her title in the estate revenue department, and the administration of Bihar (the official responsible for Bihar land mutation). The variation in title ownership might occur because of many reasons such as the loss of the original owner and transferring the land to the new owner due to inheritance. In the event of rented property, the title can be given through a certain power of attorney.</p>



<h2><strong>When is the mutation of the land or the property required?</strong></h2>



<p>The land mutation is required depending upon the type of land and the change of title/ownership. The mutation is necessary for determining the tax liability when the owner of the property/estate is changed.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-mutation-is-of-two-types"><strong>The Mutation is of two types:</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Mutation of Agricultural lands</li><li>Mutation of Non-agricultural lands</li></ul>



<p><strong>Mutation of Agricultural lands</strong> – A mutation is necessary when the case is about the agricultural lands. One cannot transfer the land ownership/title if the procedure of the mutation is not followed. In the revenue records, the owner&#8217;s name and the mutation need to be entered. The compensation shall be granted by the government to individuals who have registered or enrolled their name in the records of revenue.</p>



<p><strong>Mutation of Non-agricultural lands</strong> &#8211; A failure to transfer the title or ownership of properties like residential plots, independent houses, flats, etc. does not deny the rights to sell them. This indicates that the buyer&#8217;s name will be unchanged, and they will still be the proprietor of the estate. If the proprietor does not change these structures, they will not get water and power connection and are not inclined to give municipal tax.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-should-one-apply-for-property-mutation"><strong>When should one apply for property mutation?</strong></h2>



<p>You should appeal for the assets mutation or require to get the shift of title of property arranged in the following circumstances to bypass any legal conflicts:</p>

<p>Records of Mutation do not present the title of an estate of an individual, in the eye of the Supreme Court. At the time of passing its decision at Bhimabai Mahadeo Kambekar in comparison to Arthur Import as well as Export Company in 2019, the highest court had stated that mutation listings of tax records did not formulate or exterminate ownership over the property. The SC added such records did not hold any assumptive power on the ownership of such property.</p>



<h2><strong>Important points</strong></h2>



<p>Mentioned below are various essential details on the mutation of resources:</p>



<ul><li>The mutation of an estate is very essential whether the estate is a small land or an apartment. However, mutation on a property is very important.</li><li>Patta land or estate where the mutation is performed up-to-date can be smoothly marketed.</li><li>If the capital is collectively owned then the change in title/ownership can be declared jointly in the title or credentials of all owners.</li><li>If you are the initial proprietor of the assets (for instance, resources received in a Govt e-auction), you need to &#8220;enroll&#8221; your title in the state revenue listings. It is not the transfer of the title in this situation.</li><li>If you like to verify if capital has free ownership/title or if it is mortgaged, you need to appeal for an EC that is an Encumbrance Certificate. You can check those ownership information with the help of Mutation Extract. (Mutation Extract is a mutation register that is maintained by either the District Panchayat Accountant or the regional civic body department. It lists the transfer of land title/ownership and the method of such transfer, references of the Assessing Officer for before-mentioned transfer, day of admission of transfer as well as the ROR record of rights.)</li><li>Is mutation compulsory after the Listing of the Property? – No, it is not necessary. However, it is very important.</li><li>If a modification is not performed, does that indicate the ownership of the estate is not changed or modified from seller to purchaser, even after listing the Sale Deed? – The ownership/title gets assigned to the buyer, however, mutation of documents is better to confirm the ownership of the asset.</li><li>What if a person does a mutation of property in their name not legally? Will the person be the new owner of the property? – By hardly transferring the title in mutation listings, one cannot demand that the person has ownership of the property. Note that without the listed sale deed in a person&#8217;s name, the mutation is technically invalid as well as illegal.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When you acquire a house, a business establishment, or land, the first thing you need to do is register it. This establishes your legality to carry out any transaction. Only when a property has been registered in the name of a person, he or she is regarded as the legal owner.</p>



<p>If you fail to register the property, it will be assumed that the former owner or the builder is the legal and lawful owner. Legally, a property transaction isn&#8217;t deemed complete until the sale deed is properly stamped and registered. The main goal of registration is to keep track of who owns the property.</p>



<p>The seller of the asset is known as the &#8220;transferor,&#8221; while the buyer is known as the &#8220;transferee.&#8221; Stamp duty and registration fees are paid by the property buyer.</p>



<p>According to the Registration Act of 1908, a property must be registered for the purposes of sale, transfer, gift, or lease. All agreements involving the sale of immovable property for more than ₹100 must be registered, according to Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908. If a person does not register a property while engaging in the aforementioned transactions, the transaction won’t be approved in a legal proceeding.</p>



<h2 id="h-section-25-of-the-bihar-registration-act"><strong>Section 25 of the Bihar Registration Act</strong></h2>



<p>The paperwork required for registering a property deed must be sent to the relevant Registrar official within four months after the date of property registration, according to Section 25 of the Bihar Registration Act. In the event of a violation of the foregoing, a fine of up to 10 times the amount of the property registration fee is applied.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-advantages-of-online-property-registration-in-bihar"><strong>The Advantages of Online Property Registration in Bihar</strong></h2>



<p>By registering the property deed, you may take advantage of the following benefits:</p>



<p>• Offer assurance that the deed is genuine.</p>



<p>• Ensure that the prevention of fraud, the preservation of evidence, and the transfer of ownership to the owner.</p>



<p>• Make transactions more evident.</p>



<p>• Registering a property allows you to keep an up-to-date public record.</p>



<p>• To be able to detect whether or not the property has previously been sold.</p>



<p>• To present security of title deeds in the event that the original deeds are lost or damaged.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-happens-if-you-don-t-register-your-property"><strong>What happens if you don&#8217;t register your property?</strong></h2>



<p>The documentations will have no impact on the property and will neither provide any property rights nor any benefits of land registration in Bihar. In other terms, the purchaser will be treated by the law as an unacknowledged owner with no rights to the property.</p>



<h2 id="h-property-registration-in-bihar"><strong>Property Registration in Bihar</strong></h2>



<p>The terms describing the presentation of documentation for registration by a person are defined in Section 32 of the Registration Act of 1908. As stated in Section 33 of the Registration Act 1908, the relevant person, representative, or authorized agent must deliver the documentation to the proper registration office in order for it to be registered under the Act&#8217;s requirements.</p>



<p>It is important to note that purchasers must pay stamp duty of 6% of the transaction value and registration fees of 2% of the transaction amount to complete the formality. The stamp duty fees will be 5.7 percent if the property was sold from a man to a woman. If the situation is reversed, the stamp duty rate will be 6.3 percent. In the same way, if a property is sold from a man to a woman, the registration fee is 1.9 percent. The fee is 2.1 percent if it is sold from a woman to a man.</p>



<p>Despite repeated requests from the central government and the union Housing Ministry, most states have yet to declare any reductions in stamp duty or registration fees on property purchases following the COVID-19 outbreak. Only a few states, such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Madhya Pradesh, have declared cuts in these taxes in order to encourage purchasers to invest in real estate and boost economic activity. Despite the fact that Bihar has a very high rate of stamp duty and registration fees, it has yet to announce any reductions in these fees.</p>



<p>In a typical case, a buyer would pay ₹3 lakhs in stamp duty and ₹1 lakh in registration fees for an asset valued at ₹50 lakhs.</p>



<h2 id="h-documents-required-for-the-process-to-register-land-in-bihar"><strong>Documents Required- For the Process to Register Land in Bihar</strong></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you want to acquire a property in India, you need to know the land survey number to avoid legal complications.</p>



<p>Due to its cheaper upkeep, better resale value, varied uses, and lower investment cost compared to built structures, land has long been a popular investment Soption for Indian real estate purchasers. However, risk and reward are inextricably linked, and land is no exception. Because of the large numbers of fraudulent operations in this industry, it is critical to grasp the importance of survey numbers.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-a-land-survey-number"><strong>What is a land survey number?</strong></h2>



<p>Local governments or revenue officers issue a unique number to each portion of land in their city as a part of their record-keeping for tax purposes. The number serves as the land&#8217;s identification and is known as a land survey number. The use of land survey number is by real estate investors to gain access to property data such as the land shape, area, location, neighbourhood, and ownership rights.</p>



<p>The data is assimilated by tax officials in each state after a comprehensive investigation of the land site, and the competent government provides the land survey number. In Maharashtra, for instance, the land survey number is assigned by the Superintendent of Land Records and the Taluka Inspector of Land Records.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-may-a-buyer-benefit-from-a-land-survey-number"><strong>How may a buyer benefit from a land survey number?</strong></h2>



<p>When registering a property, the land survey number is one of the information that must be provided in the form. However, this is only one example of how this number may be used.</p>



<p>More significantly, the land survey number aids a potential buyer in inspecting and comprehending the specifics of the land he/she wishes to purchase. This number can be used by the buyer to obtain information such as:</p>



<p>• What kind of land is it, exactly?</p>



<p>• What is its location?</p>



<p>• What is the total number of persons who own it?</p>



<p>• Is it a piece of agricultural land?</p>



<p>• What are its boundaries?</p>



<p>• What additional plots exist in the vicinity of this one, and who owns them?</p>



<p>By receiving answers to these questions, the purchaser may be able to avoid any future difficulties with the transaction.</p>



<p>An example will help you understand this better. Let&#8217;s say you come across a seller who owns a piece of agricultural land on the outskirts of the city. Because non-farmers are unable to own agricultural property in India, it is necessary to modify the land use in order for a non-farmer to acquire this land. If the seller has hidden that essential information from you, you may find yourself in a lot of difficulty down the road. You can find out what sort of land it is by looking up the land survey number online and acting appropriately.</p>



<p>The same may be said for land ownership. Numerous individuals co-own land that is passed down through generations, and the permission of each of them is required for the transaction to be legally valid. An individual seller would have no chance of deceiving you if you have acquired information on all of the co-owners by reviewing the land records.</p>



<p>Consider the following factors before making a property purchase:</p>



<p>• Check the original documents for authenticity.</p>



<p>• Verify the authorized building plans in the case of an existing structure.</p>



<p>• Obtain a certificate of encumbrance from the registrar.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-procedure-for-obtaining-the-land-survey-number"><strong>What is the procedure for obtaining the land survey number?</strong></h2>



<p>The number of the land survey is stated on the sale deed. You may discover the land survey number by going to the official website of the state where the property is located. For example, the official website for the state of Andhra Pradesh is https://meebhoomi.ap.gov.in; for Haryana, it is https://jamabandi.nic.in, and so forth. If this fails to work, you can go to the municipality&#8217;s office and meet the authorities to get the information you need about the land survey number. Certain governments have created a number of smartphone apps to make land information more accessible. For instance, in the state of Karnataka, the Dishank app may be used to collect land-related data.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-method-may-be-used-to-verify-the-land-survey-number"><strong>What method may be used to verify the land survey number?</strong></h2>



<p>Cross-checking the land survey number on the sale deed with what&#8217;s mentioned on the property tax bill is a good way to make sure. If there is a mistake, you must notify the local authorities and get it corrected.</p>



<p>With the advent of technology, virtually all Indian states now make land information, including survey numbers, available online. The revenue departments of the states are responsible for maintaining these websites. On these websites, one may quickly access data on the land survey number by following a simple procedure.</p>

<p>• Visit Mahabhulekh&#8217;s official webpage at https://bhulekh.mahabhumi.gov.in/.</p>



<p>• You&#8217;ll notice an option of viewing 7/12 and 8A.</p>



<p>• You will be taken to a new page after selecting your city.</p>



<p>• Now put in the platform&#8217;s requested information, such as District, Taluka, and Village.</p>



<p>• You&#8217;ll see that you may search land records using a variety of methods, including survey number/group number, alphabetical survey number/group number, first name, last name, and full name. This is how it works: With the exception of the survey number and group number, you can select any of them.</p>



<p>• After you&#8217;ve entered the information, you&#8217;ll be able to see the specifics of the land record on your screen. The information provided will reflect the Maharashtra land survey number.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-can-the-inaccurate-number-be-corrected"><strong>How can the inaccurate number be corrected?</strong></h2>

<p>In this situation, you must examine the development&#8217;s nature. If the property is built on a subdivided and authorized plot, just the number of the plot in issue should be considered. If, on the other hand, the property owner has an undivided share of the project, then all project documentationa must be taken into account.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-word-of-caution-to-potential-purchasers"><strong>A word of caution to potential purchasers</strong></h2>



<p>It is your duty to confirm that the land portion you are purchasing has the correct survey number. Verify the land survey number and, if necessary, pay a visit to the municipal or land revenue department offices. Check if the numbers on the sale deed match the numbers on the assessment order issued by the municipal body, tax revenues, and so forth.</p>



<p>If there is a discrepancy between the number supplied by the sale and the actual land survey available on the government site, the owner must get the necessary changes through a rectification deed.</p>



<p>Another point to keep in mind when purchasing a plot is that such transactions are not covered by real estate law unless you are purchasing a plot in a developer&#8217;s plot-based project. As a result, it&#8217;s critical to be cautious and collect as much information as possible about the property using the land survey number.</p>



<p>No developer shall advertise, market, sell or offer for sale, or solicit anyone to acquire any plot, structure, or unit in any real estate project without first registering it with RERA, according to Section 3 (1) of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA). As a result, prospective purchasers should only invest in RERA-registered plots.</p>



<p>As a result, the land survey number is important for purchasing or selling property, settling legal issues (if any), and planning the development of the surrounding regions. Keep this information handy in case you become a victim of the deal&#8217;s crooks. When knowledge is just a click away, you can become a well-informed and smart purchaser.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <strong>Reserve Bank of India</strong> decides on releasing liquidity into the Indian economy. Since the first wave of the pandemic<strong>, RBI</strong> kept regulating its policy rates<strong>. At A Time When Loan Sanctions Have Remained Muted on Risk Concerns Despite an Uptick in Home Loan-Related Inquiries</strong>, RBI decided on keeping <strong>lending rate</strong> low. <strong>RBI </strong>kept its <strong>repo rate</strong> unchanged to as low as 4%, thus enabling its subsidiary scheduled banks in India to release <strong>home </strong><strong>loans</strong> at a lower <strong>interest rate</strong>.</p>
<p>To provide relief to the housing sector, the finance minister announced an <strong>alternative investment fund for real estate</strong>. It was released at <strong>25000 Cr Package for Real Estate </strong>to the housing projects withheld due to lack of funds. The <strong>relief package for real estate </strong>acted as a major saviour for the whole industry, which has a huge multiplier impact in providing jobs to millions of populations in the country.  Both these major steps taken by the government helped keep the economy stable. As the second-largest industry contributing to the Indian economy, the real estate sector demanded such strong steps.</p>
<h2><strong>Unchanged repo rate: impact on home loans </strong></h2>
<p>The <strong>monetary policy committee</strong> of the <strong>RBI</strong> fourth time in a row initiated keeping the <strong>repo rate</strong> and reverse repo rate unchanged. It was scheduled at 4% to 3.35% respectively. Owing to the situation, the commercial banks could now lend money from the central bank at low rates. This would entitle the banks to allow more credit to the <strong>home loan</strong> borrowers at a <strong>low</strong><strong>-interest rate</strong>. The move&#8217;s significance would further entitle the loan borrowers to pay lesser EMI than usually settled for.</p>
<p>There was a hike in demand for home loans amidst the pandemic, and to meet such a demand, the unchanged <strong>repo rate </strong>threw light on the need for an adequate supply of funds. With that, not just the borrowers, the FD investors were also seen in an advantageous position. The different commercial banks could now no longer be arbitrary with the interest rates. Some significant analysts considered experts in the field of real estate have observed this move of the central bank to bring about improvements in the economy.</p>
<p>As of November 2020, the <strong>interest</strong> <strong>rate </strong>of some of the major banks is Union Bank 6.70%, Bank of India 6.85%, Central Bank of India 6.85%, Punjab and Sind Bank 6.90%, Canara Bank 6.90%, SBI 6.90%, PNB 6.80%, HDFC Bank 6.90%, ICICI Bank 6.90%, Bank of Baroda 7.00%, Bank of India 6.85%.</p>
<h2><strong>Impact of RBI&#8217;s linking of risk-weightage factor to LTV only.</strong></h2>
<p><strong>RBI</strong>’s guidelines on reframing the risk-weightage norms were another boon for the real estate sector. The home borrowers were all in a win-win situation. Previously before the initiation of the central bank, the risk weightage factors were mainly two. Namely, the weightage of the loan and LTV ratio. However, the new norms of the regulatory policy mention the risk weightage factor to be related to the LTV ratio only. Any <strong>Home loan </strong>approved up to 31<sup>st</sup> March 2020 will be benefited from this new policy.</p>
<p>In cases where the LTV was as high as 80%, the risk weightage would be 35%, and for cases where LTV goes beyond 80%, the risk weightage will lie at 50%. Real estate as the second-largest employment-generating arena needed the attention and care that the central bank and the government tried to provide amidst the reckoning of the second wave of corona pandemic.</p>
<p>To the guidelines of the regulatory body, several economists threw light on the advantages of the same. The benefit is none other than maintaining employment in the sector as much as possible. Also, the home borrowers had a great chance to fulfill their dreams of owning a house.</p>
<h2><strong>RBI’S 3-month Moratorium announcement on home loan </strong></h2>
<p>With the coronavirus outbreak, its repercussions on the economy were tremendous. To revive the economy, the apex regulatory financial authority decided on granting temporary relief for the existing <strong>home loan </strong>buyers. Thus, a moratorium was announced by the central bank on 27<sup>th</sup> March 2020. As per the guidelines, the failure of parties to pay loan installment would not lead it to be seen as a &#8216;non-performing asset.&#8217;</p>
<p>It was a guideline that was allowed for the other banks in India to follow. This massive step was a true spirit to check on those suffering from a lack of liquidity. The financial crunch that the pandemic has brought is not worth comparing. However, such efforts by the <strong>monetary policy committee </strong>of the <strong>reserve bank of India </strong>is an active method. With the end of the moratorium, it was noted that the number of applicants was huge, and thus we can say the guidelines were effective in their true terms and spirit.</p>
<h2><strong>RBI changes its cash reserve ratio (CRP) norms to promote lending by the banks </strong></h2>
<p>CRP, or the cash reserve ratio, is the cash reserve deposits by commercial banks to the apex regulatory body. Thus, with the aim to promote/encourage lending of housing loans by the commercial banks, the Reserve Bank decided on an incentive policy. According to the policy announced on 6<sup>th</sup> February 2020, relaxations were granted to calculate total deposits by commercial banks.  The commercial banks could avail as much incentive depending on the increased amount of lending.</p>
<p>The sole purpose behind such a proposal was to help the targeted groups in the real estate sector. The target group under the incentive scheme included residential housing, small, micro, and medium enterprises, and retail automobile loans. The validity of the incremental process was made applicable till 31<sup>st</sup> of July 20220. The exemption was allowed for about 4% of the total deposits of each commercial bank with the <strong>RBI</strong>.</p>
<h2><strong>Stress fund for Ghaziabad: CREDAI </strong></h2>
<p>On 19<sup>th</sup> November 2019, Ghaziabad, President of CREDAI, brought to the point that about 4050 projects were entitled to be benefitted from the central government&#8217;s scheme. Most housing projects in Ghaziabad were delayed by approximately 2 to 3 years. About 14000 home buyers who were awaiting their respective deliveries could be compensated out of the scheme.</p>
<p>The president suggested changing the law whereby the home buyers could be prevented from initiating legal proceedings against respective real estate contractors. Also, he suggested that the point of contact between home buyers and their assets should be the RERA (real estate regulatory authority) instead of the consumer forum. These were the few considerations that depict the applicability of the government schemes and guidelines.</p>
<h2><strong>Central governments alternative investment fund for the real estate sector </strong></h2>
<p>The demand for housing and similarly related projects was at its peak. However, the supply was not adequate to meet the growing needs. Owing to a lack of funds, housing projects in the real estate sector were pending. The situation was taken under consideration, and Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman came up with a <strong>25000 Cr Package for Real Estate. </strong>The purpose behind the scheme was to identify and meet the needs of genuine projects that seek assistance.</p>
<p>Along with real estate contractors, the scheme was also aimed at assisting finance companies and banks. Apart from net-worth positive projects, it will also help revive or restart the projects termed as non-performing assets and those pending litigation under NCLT. Any project suffering from liquidity or credit availability issues was meant to be benefited out of the scheme of the central government.</p>
<p>The scheme was to be disposed of unit-wise. The <strong>real estate AIF</strong> provided funds to pending real estate projects with a unit size of lower than Rs 2 crore in metro cities and Rs 1 crore in other smaller places. Out of the remaining, Rs 10,000 crores were awarded to SBI and Life Insurance Corporation (LIC). Also, any project beyond the purview of registration with the real estate regulatory authority will be kept away from the benefits of the scheme. The minimum value for each project was set at Rs 400 crores.</p>
<p>The scheme was none other than a renewed version of the 14<sup>th of</sup> September 2019 “special window” plan. The new plan targeted to meet the needs of over 4.58 lakh housing units spread all over the country. The strategy behind the dispensation of the scheme was commendable as the union government reached out to the top two lenders in the country.</p>
<h2><strong>Developers welcoming relief package for real estate with open arms </strong></h2>
<p>With the <strong>real estate AIF, </strong>the government made up a full-proof plan to kick start the second largest sector in India. While cutting down restrictions on the deplorability of funds, the government was assured that funds would reach the right place for the right target. <strong>Jaxay Shah, </strong>the CREDAI chairman, threw light on the same. Now, by enabling the scheme, home buyers and real estate contractors could resume their long-stuck work if it happens to be net worth positive.</p>
<p>Most economists and potential people associated with the industry reflected on the fact that the move of the union government played the role of watering the plants of the real estate sector. The ultimate goal of promoting housing and retaining employability in the real estate sector was accomplished.</p>
<h2><strong>Concluding lines </strong></h2>
<p>To secure financial stability, the financial regulatory authority and the Union government came up with an umpty number of policies and schemes. All its efforts were directed towards securing employment structure along with promoting housing at low rates amidst the pandemic. From cutting down the repo<strong> rate </strong>and incentives on CRP, and the <strong>alternative investment fund, </strong>all of it forms part of the success story.</p>
<p>There was a welcoming attitude observed out of the experts and economists likewise. The six-member <strong>monetary policy committee </strong>worked wonders with their calculations on preventing the GDP from a drastic fall. With that, we have come to the end of this piece.

<h2><strong>FAQ’S </strong></h2>
<p><strong>1.What do repo rate and reverse repo rate stand for in the context?</strong></p>
<p>This is the most important question that most of you might be facing now. Repo rate in nothing was the rate at which the central financial regulatory body lends money to other commercial banks. Whereas the reverse repo rate is when the same authority borrows its funds.</p>
<p><strong>2.How does the moratorium announced by RBI benefit home buyers amidst covid?</strong></p>
<p>The three-month moratorium offered by the Reserve Bank of India allowed delayed payment of installments for home loans. With this policy at hand, people could retain liquidity with them for necessities and clear off debts at a later stage. Looking into the financial category of home buyers, RBI initiated the step.</p>
<p><strong>3.How long can we expect Repo rates to remain unchanged by RBI?</strong></p>
<p>Given the situation, the repo rate and repo rate cannot be expected to change any time before 2023. As they were faced with the coronavirus pandemic, the economy received a major blow. And recovery for the same would take quite some time. Based on that, one can expect low repo rates till 2023.</p>
<p><strong>4.What was the impact of the reduced repo rate on the public sector banks in India?</strong></p>
<p>In general condition, home loans were allowed by the public sector banks at an interest rate as low as 7%. For example, In September 2019, the Union Bank of India started to offer home loans at an interest rate of 6.7% per annum. Simultaneously, to keep up with the pace, the public lender SBI waived its processing fee chargeable for home loan approval.</p>
<p><strong>5.Which other sectors Does RBI aim to assist with its schemes?</strong></p>
<p>Apart from the real estate sector, RBI aims at assisting other sectors that were hit by the covid-19 pandemic. In its recent 2021 regulation, it mentioned its intention to aid the hotel and tourism industry too. The financial regulatory body allowed Rs 15000 crore for this purpose via its recent policy.</p>

<p><strong>How Much Property Tax Should I Pay?</strong></p>



<p>Now, this is a very important question. How much should you be paying for your property taxes? The point to remember here is that the amount will vary from state to state, city to city, and sometimes even from municipality to municipality, but that is hardly ever the case. Every city more or less has a plan of collecting taxes and they are done mostly through 3 systems. In one system the property tax is collected based on the market value of the property.</p>



<p>This form of calculation is seen in <a href="https://www.squareyards.com/mumbai-real-estate">Mumbai</a>, which is why maintaining your property in Mumbai is an expensive affair. In other cases, the calculation is done based on the per sqft value of the property, as we see in Kolkata. There is also a third system in which the calculation of the property tax is done based on the rentable value of the property. What this means is that how much rent would the property fetch, if it is rented – the calculation is done based on that. The property does not need to be rented. In all three systems, the property tax is to be paid by the one who owns it, not by the person who has rented it. So, how does the <strong>PCMC property tax online</strong> make its calculations? </p>



<p>The PCMC calculates its property tax values following the same one as in Mumbai. So, it calculates the property tax amount on the ready reckoner value which is determined by the market value of the property. So the amount is calculated based on that. So, this is a calculation that you can do for yourself as well. Let’s find out how. </p>



<p>First, you will have to visit the https://www.pcmcindia.gov.in/ptax_calc/index.html</p>



<p>Over here, you will have to enter the zone for which you want to calculate the taxes, like say whether it is residential, NRI, etc. </p>



<p>Once you have selected the zone, you will have to select the sub-use type, like what kind of property it is, where the property is, etc. </p>



<p>With that done, your property tax will be calculated automatically. </p>



<p>This is known as self-assessment which can be done before the <strong>PCMC property tax payment</strong>. If you get the self-assessment done, then you will be able to know from beforehand, how much tax do you need to pay and you can prepare yourself accordingly as well. This is necessary for you to be prepared and since it can be done online, it is hassle-free. </p>



<p><strong>Do We Have Rebates On Property Taxes?</strong></p>



<p>While every property owner will have to pay property taxes, there are different kinds of rebates as well which one can enjoy when it comes to them. These rebates or discounts are dependent on a lot of factors. The Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation has its own set of rebates. Let’s take a look at the various <strong>PCMC property tax</strong> rebates one can enjoy: </p>



<p>If you have a residential property or a plot of land or a non-residential property then you can also apply for rebates. You will get a 10% discount on the general tax being paid if the rateable value of the property is within Rs.25,000/-. If the rateable value is more than Rs. 25,000/-, then you will be eligible for a discount of 5%. The PCMC has a very interesting rebate method for environmentally friendly and conscious households as well. If you have solar power or practice rainwater harvesting or vermiculture, at your residence, then you will get a rebate of 5%-10%. The percentage of rebate on the <strong>PCMC property tax payment</strong> will be decided by how many eco-friendly projects as mentioned before, is there at your residence. </p>



<p>There are a few types of properties that do not have to pay any property tax at all. Let’s take a look at the list of such properties:</p>



<ul>
<li>Public burial grounds</li>
<li>Places of religious worship</li>
<li>Educational institutes</li>
<li>Crematorium </li>
<li>Heritage land</li>
<li>Charitable organizations</li>
<li>Agricultural lands</li>
</ul>



<p>These are some of the basic pointers that one needs to keep in mind when it comes to the <strong>PCMC property tax</strong>. But there are a few other important pointers that you need to bear in mind as well. </p>



<p><strong>Changing Ownership and How to Change the Name?</strong></p>



<p>Now, suppose there is a change in ownership of the property land. Then you will have to transfer the name of the owner from the old one to the new one. Now, how will you go about that process? It is also quite a simple one and can be processed if you have some of the basic documents in order. Let us find out how that is done. </p>



<p>First and foremost, there is a list of documents that you will need to have, which if you go about the process in the right manner, you will have with you. First, you will need a receipt of the last paid property tax. You will also require a no-objection form from the housing society stating and acknowledging the ownership transfer. This will not be required in the case of individual house ownership transfer for <strong>PCMC property tax payment</strong>. You will also need the sale deed. The sale deed needs to be in order, which states that the owner of the property is you, the applicant, not the previous owner. You will also need to collect the application form for name transfer from the PCMC office. </p>



<p>Once you have all the documents, their copies attested and the application form filled out, you will need to submit it to the Commissioner of Revenue, who sits at the PCMC office. Just to be on the safe side, make sure that you have a Xerox copy of the entire set of the application with yourself as a record that you have submitted it. </p>



<p><strong>Special Rebates for Women</strong></p>



<p>The Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation offers a concession on property tax for women. It was on 8th March 2011, that this is announcement was made and the concession put in place. Women do get a lot of concessions when it comes to property ownership and transfer and this was just another step to make the process easier for them because for women to rise and claim ownership in the first place is a rather difficult proposition. So, how do the <strong>PCMC property tax online</strong> grant concessions? </p>



<p>First and foremost, a woman has to be the owner of the property. </p>



<p>To inform the municipal corporation that one is eligible for the rebate, one will have to fill out a particular form known as the MAHILA REBATE PROPERTY FORM. This form is available online at https://www.pcmcindia.gov.in/ptax_forms.php</p>



<p>Once you have downloaded and filled out the form, you will then need to get a stamp paper of Rs.100/- to get it verified and submit it along with the form. </p>



<p>It will be processed with a period of 2-3 weeks and if all the documents are found to be in order, then one will start enjoying the rebates from the next cycle of <strong>PCMC property tax online payment</strong>. It is best that when you are applying for this concession, you do not sit on your application for long. Get it done as soon as possible and if there is any difficulty in processing it, get it sorted. So it is best that you file the application way ahead of the payment cycle. It is also important to note here that, the woman in whose name the property is, has to have no pending civic dues. </p>



<p>This brings us to another important question –</p>



<p><strong>What happens when you have a payment default?</strong></p>



<p>Well, though it is not at all advisable, sometimes people do forget to file their <strong>PCMC property tax</strong>. What can you do when you have not filed for or even paid your taxes? Well, you will have to clear your dues in the next cycle and it is best that you do it as early as possible. It is important to remember here that in case of payment defaults you will attract penalties, a sum which you will have to pay while paying the dues. So, when you have a default, you will have to end up paying way more than your usual property tax rate, and what is the point in doing that? You will have to fill out forms stating your default payment and then submit it and file for a late submission. It is an unnecessary hassle that can be avoided. So, how can you save yourself from being late with the payments?</p>



<p>To begin with, you will have to set a reminder. If you have an agent who looks after these matters, remind him to remind you, so that you do not miss out on the date. Self-assessment dates end before the last date of <strong>PCMC property tax online payment</strong>, so you need to keep a track of that too. It is best that you be systematic about this and not deal with it lightly. Defaulting will put a strain on your pocket, hence it is best to avoid it as much as possible. And when you are transferring a property to your name right before the tax payment cycle, make sure that your last owner pays it or you can negotiate with them and sort out the details. Do not miss out on that. </p>



<p>So, now that you have all the information that you need when it comes to <strong>PCMC property tax</strong>, be very particular about filing it, and do not miss out on the most important steps. </p>
