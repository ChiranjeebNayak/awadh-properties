The managing committees of a housing society have the key responsibility of ensuring that all the proof of sale towards the property is rightfully issued. A<strong>&nbsp;share certificate</strong>, quite like the sale deed is proper proof that the rightful owner of the said property must possess.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Sometimes,&nbsp;<strong>housing society members&nbsp;</strong>tend to overlook or forget to issue these share certificates to the members which can be a problem in case a property-related issue occurs. While the sale deed does act as proof that you are the official owner of the property, a share certificate is legal proof of the same and is indispensable.

This is given to the member at no cost and ideally, should be given within six months from the time of&nbsp;<strong>allotment of the shares in the housing society&nbsp;</strong>as per the number of shares subscribed by him/her. This share certificate is an active proof of ownership and should have the name of the said housing society, a distinctive number, number of shares allotted to the member as well as value paid after that. The&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>&nbsp;is free, and the registrar then decided the total authorized value at the time the society has been registered. In an event that the member has cleared all his or her dues and no other hitches are existing, the denial of a share certificate can entitle the member to take legal action against the cooperative&nbsp;<strong>housing society</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-why-do-you-need-a-share-certificate\"><strong>Why do you need a Share Certificate?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">A&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>&nbsp;is an indispensable document that solely acts as actual legal proof of ownership to the property and the shareholding within the society.

In such a scenario, the original&nbsp;<strong>share certificate&nbsp;</strong>will have to be given to the housing society along with any other documents as needed.

If you damage or lose this, getting a duplicate is not a simple task. However, it is difficult but not impossible. You can request the&nbsp;<strong>housing society members</strong>&nbsp;to issue you a new one and for this, you will need to follow the steps mentioned below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Step 1</strong>&nbsp;\u2013 The very first thing you will need to do is visit the local police station within your jurisdiction and file an FIR. You will need to add all the details in a registering report that will include details of whether the certificate is lost, damaged, misplaced, stolen, etc. Once this is done, you will need to retain the FIR acknowledgment by the police as you will need it for future communication and reference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Step 2</strong>&nbsp;\u2013 Once the FIR is complete, you will then need to inform the housing society members of this mishap. For this, you will be required to send a written application to them in which you will request them to issue you a new duplicate share certificate. This application will also need to have the details of what happened to the original copy. (i.e whether it is stolen, lost, misplaced, damaged, untraceable, etc.) You will also need to attach the FIR acknowledgment copy that you will have received after filing the FIR. (First Information Report).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Step 3&nbsp;</strong>\u2013 After step 2, you will need to submit an&nbsp;<strong>indemnity bond</strong>&nbsp;of Rs. 200 to the cooperative housing society. This will clear the society of all costs resulting due to the issuance of the new duplicate&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>. All costs that arise for this procedure will have to be borne by the member himself/herself. Make sure that this indemnity bond is officially notarized and attach the FIR acknowledgment copy along with it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Step 4 \u2013&nbsp;</strong>Once the above-mentioned steps are complete, the managing committee will then review your application along with all the attached paperwork in the next general body meeting in which they will decide whether they want to approve or disapprove your request.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Step 5 \u2013&nbsp;</strong>If your request is approved, the housing society will then display a notice on the main notice board of the society so that all other members can have a look. Additionally, the society will also publish notices in at least two newspapers. All of this will be in regards to the issuing of a duplicate share certificate, the cost of which will need to be paid by the applicant.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Step 6 \u2013&nbsp;</strong>You along with the society will have to wait for a minimum of 15 days to see if any objections are made.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Step 7 \u2013&nbsp;</strong>If everything goes smoothly, and no objections are made, the housing society will then issue a new duplicate share certificate to you which you will have to collect in person when ready.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">So if you have lost or misplaced your original copy and are asking yourself, &#8216;<strong>Can I get a duplicate one?</strong>&#8221; the above-mentioned procedure will help you with the same.\u00a0 The ownership of a share certificate is extremely important for a property owner in a cooperative housing society. It does not only act as a legal document for your rights but also proves the allotment of shares of that society in your name. Without this share certificate, you can face issues in the future such as transferring the property to the rightful heirs, involvement or rights in any social events, police aid in case of crime, and many other such issues that may occur. Fortunately, even if the<strong>\u00a0housing society</strong>\u00a0has forgotten to issue this share certificate to you, you can now get it at any time from them. This article has dotted all the i&#8217;s and cross all the t&#8217;s with its information on the importance of a share certificate. If you have your original copy, ensure you keep it safe and in case you don&#8217;t, go and get it today!\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-you-might-also-like\">You Might Also Like</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-yoast-seo-related-links\"><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/cooperative-housing-society\">Cooperative Housing Society: Pros and Cons of Residing in it</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/society-maintenance-charges-maharashtra\">Society Maintenance charges in Maharashtra: Your handy calculation blueprint</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/5-important-real-estate-documents-worth-keeping-and-why\">5 Important Real Estate Documents Worth Keeping and Why</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/best-societies-in-noida\">5 Best Societies in Noida</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/year-ender-2020-revisit-the-top-regulatory-policies-of-2020\">Year Ender 2020: Revisit the Top Regulatory Policies of 2020</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-frequently-asked-questions-faqs\">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>\n\n\n        <section class=\"sc_fs_faq sc_card\">\n            <div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>In case I request for a duplicate certificate and objections are raised, what happens then?</h2>                <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnfortunately, the issuance of a duplicate share certificate is not as easy as getting the original one.

            "content_html": "\n<p><strong>GIFT DEEDS: A COMPLETE GUIDE</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">All people like to give something to the one they love. Although donations are commonplace, few of us understand the legal implications of this process. The ideal way to donate is to give a <strong>gift deed</strong>. In some cases, the deed will rank above the word \u2018Will\u2019. The transfer of property to someone can be paid or given for free. When ownership transfer has nothing to do with currency transactions, this transfer is called a gift deed. The <strong>registration of a gift deed </strong>does not require any financial reward; however, the entire legal process will be followed for acquiring it. A registered deed of gift is also evidence of its own, and, unlike a will, the transfer of ownership is instantaneous, and you do not have to go to court for enforcement, which saves a lot of time and hassle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-explanation-of-gift-deeds\"><strong>EXPLANATION OF GIFT DEEDS</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Documents to register a gift deed</strong> includes the voluntary transfer of a gift from a donor to a person without a monetary bonus. Such gift transfers must be registered in accordance with the &#8220;Transfer of Property Act&#8221;. It is a means of tax avoidance. It can be transferred to an actual person or institution; the recipient must receive the gift while the donor is alive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-constitutes-as-a-gift\"><strong>WHAT CONSTITUTES AS A GIFT</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">If you <strong>register a gift deed</strong> on file, it will help avert any litigation that may occur later.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It must be either static or immovable.</li><li>It must be an existing property; that is, it must exist in the present and should not be a property to be bought in the future.</li><li>It must be transferable.</li><li>It must be tangible.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-inclusions-in-a-gift-deed\"><strong>INCLUSIONS IN A GIFT DEED</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The date and place of the issuance of the document.</li><li>Information about the donor, such as name, address, date of birth, father&#8217;s name.</li><li>Details of the giver like name, father&#8217;s name, address, and relationship with the donor.</li><li>Signatures of the donor and the recipient and the signatures of the witnesses (two witnesses) present at the time of the handover.</li><li>Photographs of the witness, donee, and donor.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-process-of-making-a-gift-deed\"><strong>PROCESS OF MAKING A GIFT DEED</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Drafting the first step &#8211; The <strong>gift deed</strong> can be drafted by a lawyer who will enunciate what will be transferred and to whom. A deed is an agreement between the giver, that is, an agreement between the giver and the recipient. Also, it can be said that it&#8217;s a reciprocal act of giving and receiving at the same time. For the gift to be effective, it must be offered voluntarily by the person, and no coercion or exchange of money is allowed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Accepting the gift &#8211; Acceptance is also an important legal requirement for a valid gift. Once the gift is sent, the recipient must accept the gift for life. Otherwise, the gift will be invalid. The validity of acceptance can be determined through acts such as possession.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Registering the gift &#8211; Unless registered, recipients of real estate gifts cannot obtain ownership of such gifts. According to the provisions of Article 123, the Transfer of Property Act, the transfer of ownership can only be carried out during and after registration and post-registration, after being certified by two witnesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Donor-Recipient Relationship- If the donor and recipient are blood relatives, some state governments may grant a stamp duty reduction, but if not, it is important to establish the donor-recipient relationship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Delivery Clause &#8211; on the gift, for example, if the recipient can rent or sell the property, etc., these clauses should be mentioned during the delivery of possession of the said property.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Revoking the gift- This mentions the express or tacit action of transferring ownership of the property, revocation of the gift, stating whether you would like the recipient to have inserted a revocation clause in the deed of gift. Both the donor and the recipient must agree to this clause.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Cite any Liabilities &#8211; rights or liabilities like if the recipient is eligible to sell off the property or lease it in the future should be mentioned expressly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-to-register-a-gift-deed\"><strong>HOW TO REGISTER A GIFT DEED</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The gift deed can be registered in accordance with the <strong>1908 Registration Act</strong>. When registering, the following steps must be followed: The property is evaluated by an expert who evaluates the donated property. It varies from person to person, and the <strong>stamp duty on gift deed</strong> for women is slightly lower. <strong>Stamp duty</strong> <strong>on gift deeds</strong> also varies from state to state and can be viewed on the official website of the state government.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-gifts-for-minors\"><em>Gifts for Minors</em></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">From a legal point of view, the owner of the property can give gifts to others. An exception to this rule is that the donor or recipient is a minor. Minors are not allowed to sign contracts; therefore, they cannot give up their property. If the donor is a minor, the donation has no legal effect. If the recipient is a minor, the natural guardian can accept the gift on their behalf. Donating property, if the gift is onerous, then the obligation can only be imposed on minors. When the recipient grows up, he/she will either accept the encumbrance or return the gift.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-is-a-verbal-real-estate-gift-legal\"><em>Is a verbal real estate gift legal?</em></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">According to Article 123 of the Transfer of Property Act, it is very important to understand that verbal transfer and unregistered real estate deals have no legal effect. No rights will be granted if the delivery does not follow the legal procedures.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-pros-and-cons\"><strong>PROS AND CONS</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It runs for the life of the donor, and the transfer is instantaneous while the will lasts after death.</li><li>The deed of a gift must be recorded; only then is it effective.</li><li>Registering makes you less prone to litigation. On the other hand, the &#8220;will&#8221; is prone to litigation.</li><li>The transfer via a deed of gift is tax-free in the hands of the donor and the recipient. It can be changed as often as possible.</li><li>In the case of deeds of gift, there are additional costs in the form of stamp duty.</li><li>Stamp duty varies from state to state.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-charges-for-a-gift-deed-registration\"><strong>CHARGES FOR A GIFT DEED REGISTRATION</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">To register the gift certificate, you must pay stamp duty, which varies from state to state. You can also pay stamp duty online or at the registry office. Below are the mentioned rates for stamp duty at a few states-</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>State</strong></td><td><strong>Stamp Duty</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Delhi</td><td>Men: 6% Women: 4%</td></tr><tr><td>Maharashtra</td><td>Agricultural land/ residential property:&nbsp;&nbsp; INR 200 Family members: 3% Other relatives: 5% &nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Gujarat</td><td>4.9% of the market value</td></tr><tr><td>Punjab</td><td>Family members: NIL Non-family members: 6%</td></tr><tr><td>Karnataka</td><td>Family members: INR 1,000- 5,000 Non-family members: 5.6% of the land value</td></tr><tr><td>Tamil Nadu</td><td>Family members: 1% Non-family: 7%</td></tr><tr><td>Rajasthan</td><td>Men: 5% Women: 4% and 3% Immediate family: 2.5% For spouse: 1% Widow: None SC/ST or BPL: 3% &nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>West Bengal</td><td>Family members: 0.5% Non-family members: 6% More than Rs 40 lakh: Surcharge of 1%</td></tr><tr><td>Uttar Pradesh</td><td>Men: 7% Women: 6%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-gift-deeds-and-tax-implication\"><strong>GIFT DEEDS AND TAX IMPLICATION</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Gift Deeds</strong> must be reported on an income tax return (ITR). In 1998, the Gift Tax Act of 1958 was repealed, but it came into force again in 2004. If the amount of stamp duty exceeds INR 50,000 and the property received does not obtain the required allowance, the tax implication would be enormous. For example, the tax rebate is INR 1.5 Lakhs, and the stamp duty is INR 4 lakhs, then the penultimate difference between is more than INR 50,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-to-revoke-a-gift-deed\"><strong>HOW TO REVOKE A GIFT DEED</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">According to Article 126 of the &#8220;Transfer of Property Act&#8221;, the gift contract can be revoked if the following conditions are met:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The donor and the recipient agree to cancel the donation.</li><li>The transfer of ownership is based only on the wishes of the one who transfers the said gift deed, and the receiver is unwilling to accept the assets.</li><li>For property created as part of a gift, this situation is not illegal or immoral. This means that the gift is not fraudulent. However, legal counsel should be sought to clear the underlying process.</li><li>Remember, once the gift contract is ready, it cannot be revoked unless a revocation clause is added. Be sure to add an &#8220;exit clause&#8221; to avoid complications in the future.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>CAN A GIFT DEED BE ALLOWED TO REGISTER IN A PERSON\u2019S PRIVATE RESIDENCE</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Article 31 of the Registration Act, it herein allows the registrar to visit the apartment or home of a person who wants to submit a <strong>gift deed certificate</strong> as evidence of a special reason (such as a physical disability). To register and accept this type of deed, the person in charge of the record must be convinced that the specific reasons provided are sufficient.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-relinquishment-deeds-and-gift-deeds\"><strong>RELINQUISHMENT DEEDS AND GIFT DEEDS</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Relinquishment deeds and gifts are different types of property transfer in the eyes of the law. The act of transfer enables a person to vacate or transfer their legal ownership of the property. However, in the deed of relinquishment, the transferred property is always hereditary, and the gifted asset is not necessarily hereditary. The person to whom the property is relinquished must be the co-owner of the property. In the case of a gifted property, anyone can do so by giving explicit favour to the property itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-format-of-a-gift-deed-sample\"><strong>FORMAT OF A GIFT DEED: SAMPLE</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-31339\" width=\"385\" height=\"501\" srcset=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-1.png 385w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-1-231x300.png 231w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-conclusion\"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">On a voluntary basis, <strong>gift deeds</strong> are an effective legal tool for the smooth transfer of property in India. It also comes with Tax exemption within certain limits. In addition, it is exempt from sales tax and central tax. The main takeaway is that it is autonomous and does not mean any monetary reward; however, it should be noted that additional <strong>stamp duty on a gift deed</strong>, which may vary from state to state.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-you-might-also-like\">You Might Also Like</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-yoast-seo-related-links\"><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/stamp-duty-and-registration-charges-in-mumbai\">Stamp Duty and Registration Charges in Mumbai</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/gift-for-griha-pravesh\">Choosing the Best Gift for Griha Pravesh: Some Top Ideas</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/section-194ia-of-income-tax-act\">Section 194IA of Income Tax Act &amp; its TDS implications on Property Purchase</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/gift-will-be-a-boost-to-the-residential-market-of-ahmedabad-and-gandhi-nagar\">GIFT will be a boost to the Residential Market of Ahmedabad and Gandhi Nagar</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/india-first-ever-district-cooling-system-revolutionizes-gift-city\">India\u2019s First Ever District Cooling System Revolutionizes GIFT City</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-frequently-asked-questions-faqs\">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>\n\n\n        <section class=\"sc_fs_faq sc_card\">\n            <div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>What are the main things recorded for a gift deed?</h2>                <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt should primarily state that the donor is gifting voluntarily, and there is no external/internal influence or coercion for the same.

            "content_text": "GIFT DEEDS: A COMPLETE GUIDE\n\n\n\nAll people like to give something to the one they love. Although donations are commonplace, few of us understand the legal implications of this process. The ideal way to donate is to give a gift deed. In some cases, the deed will rank above the word \u2018Will\u2019. The transfer of property to someone can be paid or given for free. When ownership transfer has nothing to do with currency transactions, this transfer is called a gift deed. The registration of a gift deed does not require any financial reward; however, the entire legal process will be followed for acquiring it. A registered deed of gift is also evidence of its own, and, unlike a will, the transfer of ownership is instantaneous, and you do not have to go to court for enforcement, which saves a lot of time and hassle.\n\n\n\nEXPLANATION OF GIFT DEEDS\n\n\n\nDocuments to register a gift deed includes the voluntary transfer of a gift from a donor to a person without a monetary bonus. Such gift transfers must be registered in accordance with the &#8220;Transfer of Property Act&#8221;. It is a means of tax avoidance. It can be transferred to an actual person or institution; the recipient must receive the gift while the donor is alive.\n\n\n\nWHAT CONSTITUTES AS A GIFT\n\n\n\nIf you register a gift deed on file, it will help avert any litigation that may occur later.\n\n\n\nIt must be either static or immovable.It must be an existing property; that is, it must exist in the present and should not be a property to be bought in the future.It must be transferable.It must be tangible.\n\n\n\nINCLUSIONS IN A GIFT DEED\n\n\n\nThe date and place of the issuance of the document.Information about the donor, such as name, address, date of birth, father&#8217;s name.Details of the giver like name, father&#8217;s name, address, and relationship with the donor.Signatures of the donor and the recipient and the signatures of the witnesses (two witnesses) present at the time of the handover.Photographs of the witness, donee, and donor.\n\n\n\nPROCESS OF MAKING A GIFT DEED\n\n\n\nDrafting the first step &#8211; The gift deed can be drafted by a lawyer who will enunciate what will be transferred and to whom. A deed is an agreement between the giver, that is, an agreement between the giver and the recipient. Also, it can be said that it&#8217;s a reciprocal act of giving and receiving at the same time. For the gift to be effective, it must be offered voluntarily by the person, and no coercion or exchange of money is allowed.\n\n\n\nAccepting the gift &#8211; Acceptance is also an important legal requirement for a valid gift. Once the gift is sent, the recipient must accept the gift for life. Otherwise, the gift will be invalid. The validity of acceptance can be determined through acts such as possession.\n\n\n\nRegistering the gift &#8211; Unless registered, recipients of real estate gifts cannot obtain ownership of such gifts. According to the provisions of Article 123, the Transfer of Property Act, the transfer of ownership can only be carried out during and after registration and post-registration, after being certified by two witnesses.\n\n\n\nDonor-Recipient Relationship- If the donor and recipient are blood relatives, some state governments may grant a stamp duty reduction, but if not, it is important to establish the donor-recipient relationship.\n\n\n\nDelivery Clause &#8211; on the gift, for example, if the recipient can rent or sell the property, etc., these clauses should be mentioned during the delivery of possession of the said property.\n\n\n\nRevoking the gift- This mentions the express or tacit action of transferring ownership of the property, revocation of the gift, stating whether you would like the recipient to have inserted a revocation clause in the deed of gift. Both the donor and the recipient must agree to this clause.\n\n\n\nCite any Liabilities &#8211; rights or liabilities like if the recipient is eligible to sell off the property or lease it in the future should be mentioned expressly.\n\n\n\nHOW TO REGISTER A GIFT DEED\n\n\n\nThe gift deed can be registered in accordance with the 1908 Registration Act. When registering, the following steps must be followed: The property is evaluated by an expert who evaluates the donated property. It varies from person to person, and the stamp duty on gift deed for women is slightly lower. Stamp duty on gift deeds also varies from state to state and can be viewed on the official website of the state government.\n\n\n\nGifts for Minors\n\n\n\nFrom a legal point of view, the owner of the property can give gifts to others. An exception to this rule is that the donor or recipient is a minor. Minors are not allowed to sign contracts; therefore, they cannot give up their property. If the donor is a minor, the donation has no legal effect. If the recipient is a minor, the natural guardian can accept the gift on their behalf. Donating property, if the gift is onerous, then the obligation can only be imposed on minors. When the recipient grows up, he/she will either accept the encumbrance or return the gift.\n\n\n\nIs a verbal real estate gift legal?\n\n\n\nAccording to Article 123 of the Transfer of Property Act, it is very important to understand that verbal transfer and unregistered real estate deals have no legal effect. No rights will be granted if the delivery does not follow the legal procedures.\n\n\n\nPROS AND CONS\n\n\n\nIt runs for the life of the donor, and the transfer is instantaneous while the will lasts after death.The deed of a gift must be recorded; only then is it effective.Registering makes you less prone to litigation. On the other hand, the &#8220;will&#8221; is prone to litigation.The transfer via a deed of gift is tax-free in the hands of the donor and the recipient. It can be changed as often as possible.In the case of deeds of gift, there are additional costs in the form of stamp duty.Stamp duty varies from state to state.\n\n\n\nCHARGES FOR A GIFT DEED REGISTRATION\n\n\n\nTo register the gift certificate, you must pay stamp duty, which varies from state to state. You can also pay stamp duty online or at the registry office. Below are the mentioned rates for stamp duty at a few states-\n\n\n\nStateStamp DutyDelhiMen: 6% Women: 4%MaharashtraAgricultural land/ residential property:&nbsp;&nbsp; INR 200 Family members: 3% Other relatives: 5% &nbsp;Gujarat4.9% of the market valuePunjabFamily members: NIL Non-family members: 6%KarnatakaFamily members: INR 1,000- 5,000 Non-family members: 5.6% of the land valueTamil NaduFamily members: 1% Non-family: 7%RajasthanMen: 5% Women: 4% and 3% Immediate family: 2.5% For spouse: 1% Widow: None SC/ST or BPL: 3% &nbsp;West BengalFamily members: 0.5% Non-family members: 6% More than Rs 40 lakh: Surcharge of 1%Uttar PradeshMen: 7% Women: 6%\n\n\n\nGIFT DEEDS AND TAX IMPLICATION\n\n\n\nGift Deeds must be reported on an income tax return (ITR). In 1998, the Gift Tax Act of 1958 was repealed, but it came into force again in 2004. If the amount of stamp duty exceeds INR 50,000 and the property received does not obtain the required allowance, the tax implication would be enormous. For example, the tax rebate is INR 1.5 Lakhs, and the stamp duty is INR 4 lakhs, then the penultimate difference between is more than INR 50,000.\n\n\n\nHOW TO REVOKE A GIFT DEED\n\n\n\nAccording to Article 126 of the &#8220;Transfer of Property Act&#8221;, the gift contract can be revoked if the following conditions are met:\n\n\n\nThe donor and the recipient agree to cancel the donation.The transfer of ownership is based only on the wishes of the one who transfers the said gift deed, and the receiver is unwilling to accept the assets.For property created as part of a gift, this situation is not illegal or immoral. This means that the gift is not fraudulent. However, legal counsel should be sought to clear the underlying process.Remember, once the gift contract is ready, it cannot be revoked unless a revocation clause is added. Be sure to add an &#8220;exit clause&#8221; to avoid complications in the future.\n\n\n\nCAN A GIFT DEED BE ALLOWED TO REGISTER IN A PERSON\u2019S PRIVATE RESIDENCE\n\n\n\nAccording to Article 31 of the Registration Act, it herein allows the registrar to visit the apartment or home of a person who wants to submit a gift deed certificate as evidence of a special reason (such as a physical disability). To register and accept this type of deed, the person in charge of the record must be convinced that the specific reasons provided are sufficient.\n\n\n\nRELINQUISHMENT DEEDS AND GIFT DEEDS\n\n\n\nRelinquishment deeds and gifts are different types of property transfer in the eyes of the law. The act of transfer enables a person to vacate or transfer their legal ownership of the property. However, in the deed of relinquishment, the transferred property is always hereditary, and the gifted asset is not necessarily hereditary. The person to whom the property is relinquished must be the co-owner of the property. In the case of a gifted property, anyone can do so by giving explicit favour to the property itself.\n\n\n\nFORMAT OF A GIFT DEED: SAMPLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nOn a voluntary basis, gift deeds are an effective legal tool for the smooth transfer of property in India. It also comes with Tax exemption within certain limits. In addition, it is exempt from sales tax and central tax. The main takeaway is that it is autonomous and does not mean any monetary reward; however, it should be noted that additional stamp duty on a gift deed, which may vary from state to state.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\nStamp Duty and Registration Charges in MumbaiChoosing the Best Gift for Griha Pravesh: Some Top IdeasSection 194IA of Income Tax Act &amp; its TDS implications on Property PurchaseGIFT will be a boost to the Residential Market of Ahmedabad and Gandhi NagarIndia\u2019s First Ever District Cooling System Revolutionizes GIFT City\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n\n        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhat are the main things recorded for a gift deed?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt should primarily state that the donor is gifting voluntarily, and there is no external/internal influence or coercion for the same.

            "content_html": "\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">\u201cInvest in real estate today, hold it for a few years, and then sell it for a profit.\u201d This has long been the motto for investors seeking safe, low-risk, and low-volatility assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">When selling properties such as land, apartments, villas, flats, bungalows, etc. the owner nearly always makes a profit. This is especially true if the owner has owned the property for a long time. According to Indian tax rules, the profit earned is considered income, and the income-earner is responsible for paying taxes on it. While this is necessary, under different sections of the Income Tax Act, such sellers are entitled to specific exclusions from their tax liability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The Income Tax Act, for instance, exempts long-term capital gains from taxation if they are invested in the acquisition or building of a residential property under two different sections, Section 54, and Section 54F. Many times, the question of whether a taxpayer can claim exemptions under both provisions if the investment is made in the same residential dwelling has been litigated.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-are-capital-gains\"><strong>What are capital gains?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">When you sell an asset and make a profit, this is referred to as capital gains. The difference between the selling and buying price of an item is known as capital gains. Capital loss, on the other hand, occurs when you sell an item for less than the amount you paid for it. Because the gain or profit is classified as &#8220;income&#8221; under Indian Income Tax Regulations, the person who benefits from the sale must pay tax on the profit amount.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-is-the-capital-gains-account-scheme\"><strong>What is the Capital Gains Account Scheme?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">If the asset is sold in Plan Year and the seller intends to buy a new house property before the time limit of 2 years or 3 years, the assesses must deposit the gains in the capital gains account scheme (in any branch of the public sector or bank) before the deadline for filing income tax returns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">While claiming the deduction, the money previously spent on purchase/construction, as well as the amount put in the capital gains account plan, can be claimed as a cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">However, if the money put in the Capital Gains Account Scheme is not used within the time restriction, it will be considered income for the prior year in which the three-year period has expired (from the date of transfer of the original asset).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-section-54-of-the-income-tax-act\"><strong>Section 54 of the Income Tax Act</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To qualify for the tax exemption under section 54, the taxpayer must meet the following requirements:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Individuals or Hindu Undivided Families (HUF) should be the taxpayers. Industries and corporations are not eligible for Section 54 tax advantages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 It should be a residential property that is sold. Furthermore, the seller should acquire a new residential property one year before the transfer of the old property or two years following the transfer of the old property. If the seller is building a house instead of buying one, he or she must ensure that the new property&#8217;s construction is finished within three years of the sale/transfer date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 It is recommended that the new residential property be acquired in India. If the bought property is located outside of India, the seller will not be entitled to any tax benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-section-54f-of-the-income-tax-act\"><strong>Section 54F of the Income Tax Act</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Taxpayers can get a tax reduction if they reinvest the net proceeds from the sale of a capital asset, according to Section 54F of the Income Tax Act. It should be emphasized that the capital asset sold under Section 54F should not be a residential property. Reinvestment in the acquisition or building of a residential property, however, is required to be eligible to claim exemption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The means of capital gain is the main distinction between Section 54 and Section 54F of the Income Tax Act. If the capital gain is from the sale of a residential property, the exemption is under Section 54; alternatively, it is under Section 54F. Capital gains from the sale of assets such as bonds, shares, land, gold, and so forth may be subject to Section 54F.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-common-criteria-between-the-two-provisions\"><strong>Common criteria between the two provisions</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some parallels between the sections as well. If you invest in the acquisition or construction of residential property in India, you may take advantage of both of these sections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 To be eligible for the exemption, a new residential house property must be acquired or built.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 The new residential property must be acquired one year before or two years after the property/asset is sold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Alternatively, for the construction of a house, both provisions demand completion of construction within three years after the asset&#8217;s selling date, regardless of when the work begins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 If you are unable to invest the required amount in the way described above before the tax filing deadline or one year from the date of sale, deposit the specified amount.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 There are two separate sections, tax officials believe that in order to claim simultaneous investments, you must invest in two different residences and cannot claim the exemption if you just invest in one. The Hyderabad Tax Tribunal was able to address this issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-section-54-v-s-section-54f\"><strong>Section 54 v/s Section 54F</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Section 54</strong></td><td><strong>Section 54F</strong></td></tr><tr><td>If you are looking to claim full exemption, you must invest the entire capital gains.</td><td>To claim full exemption, all sale receipts should be invested.</td></tr><tr><td>If the entire capital gain is not invested, the uninvested portion is taxed as long-term capital gains.</td><td>If the entire sale proceeds are not invested, a proportional exemption is granted. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>During the sale of the original asset, one should not own more than 1 residential property.</td></tr><tr><td>If you sell this new property within three years of acquisition, the exemption will be revoked, and capital gains on the sale will be taxed as short-term capital gains.</td><td>If you sell this new property within three years of its acquisition or construction.

            "content_text": "\u201cInvest in real estate today, hold it for a few years, and then sell it for a profit.\u201d This has long been the motto for investors seeking safe, low-risk, and low-volatility assets.\n\n\n\nWhen selling properties such as land, apartments, villas, flats, bungalows, etc. the owner nearly always makes a profit. This is especially true if the owner has owned the property for a long time. According to Indian tax rules, the profit earned is considered income, and the income-earner is responsible for paying taxes on it. While this is necessary, under different sections of the Income Tax Act, such sellers are entitled to specific exclusions from their tax liability.\n\n\n\nThe Income Tax Act, for instance, exempts long-term capital gains from taxation if they are invested in the acquisition or building of a residential property under two different sections, Section 54, and Section 54F. Many times, the question of whether a taxpayer can claim exemptions under both provisions if the investment is made in the same residential dwelling has been litigated.\n\n\n\nWhat are capital gains?\n\n\n\nWhen you sell an asset and make a profit, this is referred to as capital gains. The difference between the selling and buying price of an item is known as capital gains. Capital loss, on the other hand, occurs when you sell an item for less than the amount you paid for it. Because the gain or profit is classified as &#8220;income&#8221; under Indian Income Tax Regulations, the person who benefits from the sale must pay tax on the profit amount.\n\n\n\nWhat is the Capital Gains Account Scheme?\n\n\n\nIf the asset is sold in Plan Year and the seller intends to buy a new house property before the time limit of 2 years or 3 years, the assesses must deposit the gains in the capital gains account scheme (in any branch of the public sector or bank) before the deadline for filing income tax returns.\n\n\n\nWhile claiming the deduction, the money previously spent on purchase/construction, as well as the amount put in the capital gains account plan, can be claimed as a cost.\n\n\n\nHowever, if the money put in the Capital Gains Account Scheme is not used within the time restriction, it will be considered income for the prior year in which the three-year period has expired (from the date of transfer of the original asset).\n\n\n\nSection 54 of the Income Tax Act\n\n\n\nTo qualify for the tax exemption under section 54, the taxpayer must meet the following requirements:\n\n\n\n\u2022 Individuals or Hindu Undivided Families (HUF) should be the taxpayers. Industries and corporations are not eligible for Section 54 tax advantages.\n\n\n\n\u2022 It should be a residential property that is sold. Furthermore, the seller should acquire a new residential property one year before the transfer of the old property or two years following the transfer of the old property. If the seller is building a house instead of buying one, he or she must ensure that the new property&#8217;s construction is finished within three years of the sale/transfer date.\n\n\n\n\u2022 It is recommended that the new residential property be acquired in India. If the bought property is located outside of India, the seller will not be entitled to any tax benefits.\n\n\n\nSection 54F of the Income Tax Act\n\n\n\nTaxpayers can get a tax reduction if they reinvest the net proceeds from the sale of a capital asset, according to Section 54F of the Income Tax Act. It should be emphasized that the capital asset sold under Section 54F should not be a residential property. Reinvestment in the acquisition or building of a residential property, however, is required to be eligible to claim exemption.\n\n\n\nThe means of capital gain is the main distinction between Section 54 and Section 54F of the Income Tax Act. If the capital gain is from the sale of a residential property, the exemption is under Section 54; alternatively, it is under Section 54F. Capital gains from the sale of assets such as bonds, shares, land, gold, and so forth may be subject to Section 54F.\n\n\n\nCommon criteria between the two provisions\n\n\n\nThere are some parallels between the sections as well. If you invest in the acquisition or construction of residential property in India, you may take advantage of both of these sections.\n\n\n\n\u2022 To be eligible for the exemption, a new residential house property must be acquired or built.\n\n\n\n\u2022 The new residential property must be acquired one year before or two years after the property/asset is sold.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Alternatively, for the construction of a house, both provisions demand completion of construction within three years after the asset&#8217;s selling date, regardless of when the work begins.\n\n\n\n\u2022 If you are unable to invest the required amount in the way described above before the tax filing deadline or one year from the date of sale, deposit the specified amount.\n\n\n\n\u2022 There are two separate sections, tax officials believe that in order to claim simultaneous investments, you must invest in two different residences and cannot claim the exemption if you just invest in one. The Hyderabad Tax Tribunal was able to address this issue.\n\n\n\nSection 54 v/s Section 54F\n\n\n\nSection 54Section 54FIf you are looking to claim full exemption, you must invest the entire capital gains.To claim full exemption, all sale receipts should be invested.If the entire capital gain is not invested, the uninvested portion is taxed as long-term capital gains.If the entire sale proceeds are not invested, a proportional exemption is granted. &nbsp;&nbsp;During the sale of the original asset, one should not own more than 1 residential property.If you sell this new property within three years of acquisition, the exemption will be revoked, and capital gains on the sale will be taxed as short-term capital gains.If you sell this new property within three years of its acquisition or construction. Or if you buy another residential property within two years of the sale of the original asset or construct a residential property other than the new house within three years of the sale of the original asset, this exemption will be revoked. The sale&#8217;s capital gains will be taxed as long-term capital gains.A once-in-a-lifetime exemption is provided for investing in two properties providing capital gains.No such exemption is available.\n\n\n\nWhat is the maximum amount of exemption permitted under Section 54 of the Income Tax Act?\n\n\n\nThe amount of the long-term capital gains tax exemption under Section 54 of the Income Tax Act will be the lesser of:\n\n\n\nLong-term capital gains on the sale of a primary residence, or\n\n\n\nThe amount of money spent on the acquisition or building of a new residential home. As a result, any remaining capital gains (if any) will be taxed.\n\n\n\nTo give you an example:\n\n\n\nJohn sells his villa (home) for \u20b945,00,000/-.\n\n\n\nHe buys another villa for \u20b920,00,000/- using the profits of the sale.\n\n\n\nThe following is how capital gains will be calculated:\n\n\n\nParticularsAmount (INR)Capital gain on the sale of a residential property45,00,000Less: Invested in residential house property20,00,000Balance \u2013 Capital Gains25,00,000\n\n\n\nThe exemption will be the lesser of \u20b945,00,000 in capital gains or \u20b920,00,000 in new property investment, therefore the exemption will be \u20b920,00,000.\n\n\n\nVENKATA RAMANA UMAREDDY\n\n\n\nThe assessee received long-term capital gain (LTCG) from the transfer of two different and independent assets \u2014 one a piece of land and the other a residential property \u2013 during the relevant financial year.

            "content_html": "\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">A <strong>will</strong> is a statement of legal intent that a person wants to make after death, and after the <strong>testator </strong>makes the will, it can only be revoked during his lifetime. A copy of the will be affixed with a court seal of jurisdiction to transfer the estate management rights of the <strong>testator</strong>; inheritance can only be transferred to the executor specified in the <strong>will </strong>to the <strong>legal heir</strong>. In law, this Caveat can be declared as a warning or a preventive measure (usually in <strong>probate</strong> cases) without considering a certain issue. The solution is: if it is not approved, do not listen to the non-issued order and file a disclaimer. This can be done on an application that has already been submitted, or it can be done in the future. According to the <strong>Indian Succession Act of 1925</strong>, <strong>probate</strong> is defined as follows: probate refers to a copy of the will with the seal of a court of jurisdiction and transfer of the <strong>testator&#8217;s </strong>estate management rights. The person who made the will has shown an interest in their wishes to be executed by certain people who are usually mentioned as executors after his death. The probate determines the authenticity of the will and finally proves the authenticity as well. Probate is conclusive evidence of the legal execution of a will, and it is the true and final will of the deceased.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-does-it-work\"><strong>HOW DOES IT WORK?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Probate</strong> is the analysis and management of the transfer of assets that previously belonged to the deceased. When the owner dies, their property is usually reviewed by the succession court. The probate process usually first analyzes whether the deceased has made a <strong>will</strong> that is legalized; in many cases, the deceased has drafted documents that include instructions on how to distribute the property after death; however, in some cases, the deceased will not leave a will.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-is-a-probate-with-a-legal-will\"><strong>WHAT IS A PROBATE WITH A LEGAL WILL?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The deceased who created the <strong>will</strong> is called the <strong>testator</strong>. After the <strong>testator</strong> dies, the executor is responsible for initiating the probate procedure. The contractor is usually a financial consultant. The executor is responsible for depositing the will in the <strong>probate court</strong>. States may have different rules on how long a will must be filed after death. Submitting for inheritance will start the inheritance process. A will is a process of judicial control. Firstly, it is necessary to confirm the will&#8217;s authenticity and make it valid and accepted as the true last will of the deceased; then, the court officially appoints the executor specified in the will, and the executor gets authorized to act on behalf of the deceased.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-why-is-it-necessary\"><strong>WHY IS IT NECESSARY?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The public does not know under what circumstances a will is binding. According to the <strong>Indian Succession Act of 1925</strong>, a will is mandatory if it is made under the control of the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal and may be within the local limits of the original civil jurisdiction customary to the High Courts of Madras and Mumbai Judiciary. These provisions refer to places known in India when the 1925 Inheritance Act was promulgated. Today, this refers to the metropolises of West Bengal, Chennai, and Mumbai. If the will was drafted by Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, or Buddhists, then the mandatory rules of testament above apply. Interestingly, if the will is within the geographic range of these locations, the will is binding, even if the will does not apply to real estate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Therefore, if you do not meet any of these three conditions, you do not need a will; however, even if you do not, there is no legal restriction on obtaining a will. If the validity of the will in the future may be questioned for any reason. Many housing companies do not insist on probate when transferring apartments on behalf of the decedent of the apartment. For example, as an office located in the above three regions, a housing company or the authority responsible for the registration of the owner&#8217;s details might need the absolution of probate, which will be used for the transfer of property.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-is-a-probate-without-a-will\"><strong>WHAT IS A PROBATE WITHOUT A WILL?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">If a person dies without a will, then they are considered to have died without a will. An intestate estate is also a will that is submitted to the court and is declared invalid. The probate procedure involves the distribution of the deceased\u2019s property in accordance with national laws. If the deceased has no assets, there is no need for a will. Generally, the succession process begins with the appointment of an administrator to supervise the property of the deceased. The administrator can also resolve outstanding claims. The trustee is responsible for determining the <strong>legal heirs</strong> of the deceased, including the surviving spouse, children, and parents. The probate court will determine what property is divided among the <strong>legal heirs</strong> and how the inheritance laws of most states divide the estate between the surviving spouse and the children of the deceased.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-to-apply-for-a-probate\"><strong>HOW TO APPLY FOR A PROBATE</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">An executor must appeal to the court for the probate. The executor must attach the original will along with the application. In the application, the executor must provide the name and address of the <strong>legal heir of the testator</strong> before notice. The court will require the plaintiff to prove the death of the testator, which is done with a death certificate given by the local authority. The executor must also prove that the will submitted to the court is the deceased&#8217;s last will; the applicant must also prove the submitted will is legally executed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-who-are-eligible-for-a-probate\"><strong>WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR A PROBATE</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The executor must send an application to the court for the will; the executor must attach the original will to the application; must also indicate the name and address of the legal heir of the deceased in the application so that they can be notified before the will is approved. The court usually requires the plaintiff to provide evidence of the death of the testator, which is done with the help of a death certificate issued by the local authority. The executor is also obliged to prove that the will submitted to the court is the last will of the testator and to prove to the applicant that the will is legally executed by the testator.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-challenges-to-a-probate\"><strong>CHALLENGES TO A PROBATE</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Refuting a will can be quite intimidating. In most cases, the court strictly abides by the will because the testator no longer exists for defense; however, if you are interested in the will, you can object to it, and if you can persuade the court, you can revoke it in whole or in a part will. You must consult a lawyer before questioning a will because the right to avoid a will is complicated, and each case is unusual.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em><strong>Lack of enforcement:</strong></em></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">A valid will must be signed and written by the testator in the presence of two witnesses. They must also confirm the will; if the procedures are not strictly followed, the will can be challenged in court as per law.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em><strong>Lack of testamentary capacity:</strong></em></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The law stipulates that people over 18 years of age can make a will. It is assumed that adults have legal capacity so that they can challenge the will for reasons such as old age, insanity, and senility. Other factors include that the testator is affected by a certain substance or mentally incapable of creating a will. In principle, to challenge the will based on intelligence, the opponent of the will does not have to know the consequences of making the will in the first place.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em><strong>Improper influence:</strong></em></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The estate applicant can challenge the will by proving that the will was obtained through fraud, forgery, or undue influence.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em><strong>The dearth of approval:</strong></em></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A will challenger may claim that the testator did not know the contents of the will when he signed it initially.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em><strong>Family complaints</strong></em></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Family members can object to the will because there is no inclusion of them recorded in the will.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em><strong>Revocation of a previous will</strong></em></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The revocation of an earlier will, even if it is registered, can be challenged in court. Registration of the will (not required by law to register the will) alone is not enough to dispel all suspicions about a registered will, as a registered will cannot be the last will. A new will, even if it is not registered, takes precedence over the registered will. In the event of suspicion, the court examines the will, even if it is registered.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-judicial-process-for-a-probate\"><strong>JUDICIAL PROCESS FOR A PROBATE</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">After submitting the application, it is checked, and the legal heir of the deceased is then informed that the court has received the inheritance application. To object to the granting of the inheritance, a notice can also be issued. If the court does not object, the succession will be waived. If the court receives objections to the probate issue, the application becomes a probate judgment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-probate-costs\"><strong>PROBATE COSTS</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Since the estate is awarded by a higher court, you must pay a court fee based on the property&#8217;s value in question. Court fees are varied, and each is set according to the state. It is 2% to 7.5% from Maharashtra, depending on the plates, subject to a maximum of INR 75,000. In addition to the court fees, you will also have to pay legal fees.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-location-of-the-assets-of-the-deceased\"><strong>LOCATION OF THE ASSETS OF THE DECEASED</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>First, the executor is to find and possess all the deceased&#8217;s assets to protect them during the probate process. Some people have assets that have not been disclosed to anyone (including their spouse), and these assets may not appear in their will.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>As far as real estate is involved, the executor should not move into an apartment or building and stay there throughout the probate process to &#8220;protect&#8221; it. However, you need to make sure that you have paid property taxes, insurance is up to date, and all mortgages avoid foreclosure and property loss.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>However, beneficiaries can own other assets, such as collectibles or even cars, by keeping them in a safe place. Other places to check will be bank and investment accounts as well as stocks and bonds.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>SETTLEMENT OF THE DEBTS</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The executor will use the estate to settle all debts and final accounts of the testator, including those incurred during the last illness.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>TAX RETURNS READYING AND SUBSEQUENT FILING</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The executor files the final income tax return of the testator for the year of death. It is then determined whether the estate is subject to inheritance tax and, if so, file those tax returns as well. You will also be paid with inheritance funds. This can sometimes involve liquidating assets to raise money. Inheritance taxes are generally due within nine months of the deceased&#8217;s death.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Endeavouring to make the will is a time-consuming task that the executor has to perform. The testator has to spend money and time paying court fees depending on the value of the inherited property. Still, by virtue of the will, as mentioned above, it is only in certain cases compulsory to apply for the will, while in other cases, it is not necessary to apply for the will.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-you-might-also-like\">You Might Also Like</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-yoast-seo-related-links\"><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/pataudi-palace-taimurs-%e2%82%b9800-cr-royal-inheritance\">Pataudi Palace \u2013 Taimur\u2019s \u20b9800 Cr Royal Inheritance</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/what-is-tnreginet-inspector-general-of-registration\">What is the Tnreginet Inspector General of registration?</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/a-sneak-peek-into-irrfan-khans-home-to-take-you-down-the-memory-lane\">A sneak peek into Irrfan Khan\u2019s home to take you down the memory lane!</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/bombay-high-court-provides-relief-to-real-estate-projects-at-ghodbunder-road-thane\">Bombay High Court provides relief to real estate projects at Ghodbunder Road, Thane</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/file-a-consumer-complaint-online-in-consumer-court-forum\">File A Consumer Complaint Online in Consumer Court/Forum</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-frequently-asked-questions-faqs\">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>\n\n\n        <section class=\"sc_fs_faq sc_card\">\n            <div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Who or what is considered an heir?</h2>                <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAn heir is referred to as someone who will legally inherit some form of property or estate of somebody else who has passed away without making a legal last will and testament.                    </p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </section>\n\t        <section class=\"sc_fs_faq sc_card\">\n            <div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>What is a testamentary will?</h2>                <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis is also known as a traditional last will.

In the event of suspicion, the court examines the will, even if it is registered.\n\n\n\nJUDICIAL PROCESS FOR A PROBATE\n\n\n\nAfter submitting the application, it is checked, and the legal heir of the deceased is then informed that the court has received the inheritance application. To object to the granting of the inheritance, a notice can also be issued. If the court does not object, the succession will be waived. If the court receives objections to the probate issue, the application becomes a probate judgment.\n\n\n\nPROBATE COSTS\n\n\n\nSince the estate is awarded by a higher court, you must pay a court fee based on the property&#8217;s value in question. Court fees are varied, and each is set according to the state. It is 2% to 7.5% from Maharashtra, depending on the plates, subject to a maximum of INR 75,000. In addition to the court fees, you will also have to pay legal fees.\n\n\n\nLOCATION OF THE ASSETS OF THE DECEASED\n\n\n\nFirst, the executor is to find and possess all the deceased&#8217;s assets to protect them during the probate process. Some people have assets that have not been disclosed to anyone (including their spouse), and these assets may not appear in their will.\n\n\n\nAs far as real estate is involved, the executor should not move into an apartment or building and stay there throughout the probate process to &#8220;protect&#8221; it. However, you need to make sure that you have paid property taxes, insurance is up to date, and all mortgages avoid foreclosure and property loss.\n\n\n\nHowever, beneficiaries can own other assets, such as collectibles or even cars, by keeping them in a safe place. Other places to check will be bank and investment accounts as well as stocks and bonds.\n\n\n\nSETTLEMENT OF THE DEBTS\n\n\n\nThe executor will use the estate to settle all debts and final accounts of the testator, including those incurred during the last illness.\n\n\n\nTAX RETURNS READYING AND SUBSEQUENT FILING\n\n\n\nThe executor files the final income tax return of the testator for the year of death. It is then determined whether the estate is subject to inheritance tax and, if so, file those tax returns as well. You will also be paid with inheritance funds. This can sometimes involve liquidating assets to raise money. Inheritance taxes are generally due within nine months of the deceased&#8217;s death.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nEndeavouring to make the will is a time-consuming task that the executor has to perform. The testator has to spend money and time paying court fees depending on the value of the inherited property. Still, by virtue of the will, as mentioned above, it is only in certain cases compulsory to apply for the will, while in other cases, it is not necessary to apply for the will.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\nPataudi Palace \u2013 Taimur\u2019s \u20b9800 Cr Royal InheritanceWhat is the Tnreginet Inspector General of registration?A sneak peek into Irrfan Khan\u2019s home to take you down the memory lane!Bombay High Court provides relief to real estate projects at Ghodbunder Road, ThaneFile A Consumer Complaint Online in Consumer Court/Forum\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n\n        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWho or what is considered an heir?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAn heir is referred to as someone who will legally inherit some form of property or estate of somebody else who has passed away without making a legal last will and testament.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhat is a testamentary will?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis is also known as a traditional last will.

            "content_html": "\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">When a buyer pays a number of taxes while buying a commercial property, tax liabilities will ultimately increase for the seller as well. Besides capital gains tax, it is likewise liable for the seller to pay the tax deducted at source or TDS during the sale.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-exactly-is-tds\">What exactly is TDS?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The idea of tax deducted at source had been introduced with the objective of collecting tax from the same income source. According to this concept, a deductor or individual liable for paying any particular tax to another individual (deductee) shall be deducting tax at the source and remitting it into the central government&#8217;s account. The deductor will be entitled to receive a credit of the sum which has been deducted based on a TDS certificate produced by the deductor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Interestingly, the responsibility of deducting the TDS amount and submitting it to the government does not lie on the seller but the buyer. If they cannot discharge this responsibility, they have to pay the penalty in the long run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">In order to verify the rampant usage of unaccounted cash in transactions of immovable property, a law has been introduced by the government of India; wherein, the buyer of the property needs to deduct the tax at the source.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-who-is-accountable-for-deducting-tax-u-s-194ia\">Who is accountable for deducting tax u/s 194IA?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Any individual, being a transferee accountable for paying any sum to a resident transferor by consideration for the transfer of an immovable property (apart from agricultural land), is accountable for deducting tax under this particular section.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Consequently, in case the immovable property has been bought for any particular value from any non-resident person, no TDS will be needed to be deducted whatsoever. Nevertheless, TDS is going to be deducted under Section 195.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-properties-that-are-covered\">Properties that are covered</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Section 194IA of the Income Tax Act reads that an individual, being a transferee, accountable for paying any sum to a resident transferor by way of consideration, for transferring any immovable property (apart from agricultural land)- the amount will be deducted which is equal to 1% of such amount as income tax at the time of credit of such amount to the transferor&#8217;s account or while paying such amount in cash or by the issue of a draft or cheque or any other mode, whichever happens, to be earlier. This particular section needs a purchaser to deduct tax at a 1% rate of the sale consideration if the transaction&#8217;s value happens to be \u20b950 lakhs or even more. The section is going to cover commercial property, residential property in addition to land. Nevertheless, transactions relating to the purchase of agricultural land will not be covered under this particular provision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Moreover, the treatment of properties that any NRI is marketing will be different given that the capital gains tax will also be deducted by the government from NRIs together with the TDS. For this reason, the rate of TDS is going to be much higher in these cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-when-the-tds-should-be-deducted-and-how-should-it-be-paid\">When the TDS should be deducted, and how should it be paid?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">It is imperative for the property\u2019s purchaser to deduct the TDS while executing the conveyance deed or while paying advance in the event of any advance being paid before the conveyance deed is executed. The TDS amount has to be deposited by the purchaser to the central government\u2019s credit within a period of 30 days from the conclusion of the month during which the tax is deducted. For paying the TDS and furnishing other particulars, it is essential to fill in Form 26Qb. Separate Form 26QB has to be filled in for every single set of seller and buyer in case the property has in excess of 1 buyer or seller. Therefore, one has to submit the particulars of every single buyer and seller in each Form 26QB.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-threshold-limit-u-s-194ia\">Threshold Limit u/s 194IA</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">No tax will be deductible, in case the consideration payable or paid for transferring an immovable property happens to be less than \u20b950, 00,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-tds-rate-under-section-194ia\">TDS rate under Section 194IA</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Tax is going to be deducted at a 1% rate. No Health &amp; Education Cess and surcharge is going to be included in the above rates. Consequently, tax is going to be deducted at the basic rate at the source. The TDS rate is going to be 20% in every single case, in case PAN isn\u2019t quoted.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-bank-lender-will-finance-immovable-property-partly\">The bank/lender will finance immovable property partly</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">In case the bank/lender partly finances the immovable property. It will be indispensable to deduct TDS on the entire consideration amount by the transferee irrespective of the financing amount. According to section 194IA, an individual, being a transferee, will be accountable for deducting tax at the source. Once any loan is obtained from the bank, the bank cannot be considered a transferee even though it might provide funds to the purchaser. Consequently, the buyer will deduct the entire TDS from the sum paid by him to the seller, while the bank will not be accountable for deducting TDS on payment done by him on behalf of the buyer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-illustration\">Illustration</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Suppose an immovable property worth \u20b9 60 lakh has been purchased by Y, and \u20b9 40 lakhs has been financed with the bank while the remaining has been contributed by him. The TDS to be deducted and deposited by Mr. Y happens to be \u20b9 60,000/- (\u20b9 60 lakhs @ 1%). Therefore, \u20b9 40 lakhs will be paid by the bank to the transferor, and Mr. Y is going to pay \u20b9 19.40 lakhs.

Nevertheless, in case any refundable deposit is made for the maintenance of the club/flat as well as other amenities, these will not be considered for TDS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">A residential house property was purchased by Mr. A for \u20b9 2 crores, and this consisted of the subsequent consideration:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Towards vehicle parking: \u20b9 20 lakhs</li><li>Towards purchasing immovable property: \u20b9 160 lakhs</li><li>Towards electricity and water facility: \u20b9 20 lakhs</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">If payment is made before or on 30 June 2019, the tax will be deducted by Mr. X at a 1% rate of \u20b9 160 lakhs, equal to \u20b9 1, 60,000.

One will get comprehensive guidelines for filling up the form and payment of tax on the official website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">In general, a tax deduction account number (TAN) has to be obtained by every single individual who is accountable for deducting TDS. Nevertheless, the buyer doesn&#8217;t need to obtain the tax deduction account number in the event of TDS on any property which is immovable. It is essential for you to provide particulars such as the name, address, mobile number, PAN, and email ID of the buyer and the seller in Form 26QB. It is likewise important to provide the property&#8217;s complete address together with the total value of consideration, date of the agreement, date of payment, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The buyer has to make sure that the seller\u2019s PAN is correct. Or else, it will not be possible for the seller to obtain the credit for tax which the buyer has deducted since the credit is going to flow according to the PAN card particulars furnished in Form 26QB.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">It is possible to pay the TDS online, or it can also be deposited offline.

It is important to keep in mind that although the seller might be compelled to make the payment, the buyer and none else would face the penalty.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-essential-things-to-bear-in-mind-regarding-tds\">Essential things to bear in mind regarding TDS</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">It is imperative for the buyers to deduct and pay TDS to the authorities on the property whose value happens to be more than 50 lakhs.

            "content_text": "When a buyer pays a number of taxes while buying a commercial property, tax liabilities will ultimately increase for the seller as well. Besides capital gains tax, it is likewise liable for the seller to pay the tax deducted at source or TDS during the sale.\n\n\n\nWhat exactly is TDS?\n\n\n\nThe idea of tax deducted at source had been introduced with the objective of collecting tax from the same income source. According to this concept, a deductor or individual liable for paying any particular tax to another individual (deductee) shall be deducting tax at the source and remitting it into the central government&#8217;s account. The deductor will be entitled to receive a credit of the sum which has been deducted based on a TDS certificate produced by the deductor.\n\n\n\nInterestingly, the responsibility of deducting the TDS amount and submitting it to the government does not lie on the seller but the buyer. If they cannot discharge this responsibility, they have to pay the penalty in the long run.\n\n\n\nIn order to verify the rampant usage of unaccounted cash in transactions of immovable property, a law has been introduced by the government of India; wherein, the buyer of the property needs to deduct the tax at the source.\n\n\n\nWho is accountable for deducting tax u/s 194IA?\n\n\n\nAny individual, being a transferee accountable for paying any sum to a resident transferor by consideration for the transfer of an immovable property (apart from agricultural land), is accountable for deducting tax under this particular section.\n\n\n\nConsequently, in case the immovable property has been bought for any particular value from any non-resident person, no TDS will be needed to be deducted whatsoever. Nevertheless, TDS is going to be deducted under Section 195.\n\n\n\nProperties that are covered\n\n\n\nSection 194IA of the Income Tax Act reads that an individual, being a transferee, accountable for paying any sum to a resident transferor by way of consideration, for transferring any immovable property (apart from agricultural land)- the amount will be deducted which is equal to 1% of such amount as income tax at the time of credit of such amount to the transferor&#8217;s account or while paying such amount in cash or by the issue of a draft or cheque or any other mode, whichever happens, to be earlier. This particular section needs a purchaser to deduct tax at a 1% rate of the sale consideration if the transaction&#8217;s value happens to be \u20b950 lakhs or even more. The section is going to cover commercial property, residential property in addition to land. Nevertheless, transactions relating to the purchase of agricultural land will not be covered under this particular provision.\n\n\n\nMoreover, the treatment of properties that any NRI is marketing will be different given that the capital gains tax will also be deducted by the government from NRIs together with the TDS. For this reason, the rate of TDS is going to be much higher in these cases.\n\n\n\nWhen the TDS should be deducted, and how should it be paid?\n\n\n\nIt is imperative for the property\u2019s purchaser to deduct the TDS while executing the conveyance deed or while paying advance in the event of any advance being paid before the conveyance deed is executed. The TDS amount has to be deposited by the purchaser to the central government\u2019s credit within a period of 30 days from the conclusion of the month during which the tax is deducted. For paying the TDS and furnishing other particulars, it is essential to fill in Form 26Qb. Separate Form 26QB has to be filled in for every single set of seller and buyer in case the property has in excess of 1 buyer or seller. Therefore, one has to submit the particulars of every single buyer and seller in each Form 26QB.\n\n\n\nThreshold Limit u/s 194IA\n\n\n\nNo tax will be deductible, in case the consideration payable or paid for transferring an immovable property happens to be less than \u20b950, 00,000.\n\n\n\nTDS rate under Section 194IA\n\n\n\nTax is going to be deducted at a 1% rate. No Health &amp; Education Cess and surcharge is going to be included in the above rates. Consequently, tax is going to be deducted at the basic rate at the source. The TDS rate is going to be 20% in every single case, in case PAN isn\u2019t quoted.\n\n\n\nThe bank/lender will finance immovable property partly\n\n\n\nIn case the bank/lender partly finances the immovable property. It will be indispensable to deduct TDS on the entire consideration amount by the transferee irrespective of the financing amount. According to section 194IA, an individual, being a transferee, will be accountable for deducting tax at the source. Once any loan is obtained from the bank, the bank cannot be considered a transferee even though it might provide funds to the purchaser. Consequently, the buyer will deduct the entire TDS from the sum paid by him to the seller, while the bank will not be accountable for deducting TDS on payment done by him on behalf of the buyer.\n\n\n\nIllustration\n\n\n\nSuppose an immovable property worth \u20b9 60 lakh has been purchased by Y, and \u20b9 40 lakhs has been financed with the bank while the remaining has been contributed by him. The TDS to be deducted and deposited by Mr. Y happens to be \u20b9 60,000/- (\u20b9 60 lakhs @ 1%). Therefore, \u20b9 40 lakhs will be paid by the bank to the transferor, and Mr. Y is going to pay \u20b9 19.40 lakhs. If the payment is made in installments, the amount will be deductible in proportion to the installment paid.\n\n\n\nWhile a Flat was allotted by the builder, the consideration consists of payment for Permanent Membership of Club, Car Parking, Electricity meter and line laying charges as well as other incidental charges.\n\n\n\nTDS will be applicable on all these payments since these are part of the condition and consideration for the transfer of immovable property. Nevertheless, in case any refundable deposit is made for the maintenance of the club/flat as well as other amenities, these will not be considered for TDS.\n\n\n\nA residential house property was purchased by Mr. A for \u20b9 2 crores, and this consisted of the subsequent consideration:\n\n\n\nTowards vehicle parking: \u20b9 20 lakhsTowards purchasing immovable property: \u20b9 160 lakhsTowards electricity and water facility: \u20b9 20 lakhs\n\n\n\nIf payment is made before or on 30 June 2019, the tax will be deducted by Mr. X at a 1% rate of \u20b9 160 lakhs, equal to \u20b9 1, 60,000. If the payment is made on or after 1 September 2019, the tax will be deducted on a total consideration of \u20b9 2, 00,000.\n\n\n\nParticulars needed for paying the TDS\n\n\n\nThe buyer is required to comply with the need to deduct TDS as well as paying the sum to the central government. One will get comprehensive guidelines for filling up the form and payment of tax on the official website.\n\n\n\nIn general, a tax deduction account number (TAN) has to be obtained by every single individual who is accountable for deducting TDS. Nevertheless, the buyer doesn&#8217;t need to obtain the tax deduction account number in the event of TDS on any property which is immovable. It is essential for you to provide particulars such as the name, address, mobile number, PAN, and email ID of the buyer and the seller in Form 26QB. It is likewise important to provide the property&#8217;s complete address together with the total value of consideration, date of the agreement, date of payment, and so on.\n\n\n\nThe buyer has to make sure that the seller\u2019s PAN is correct. Or else, it will not be possible for the seller to obtain the credit for tax which the buyer has deducted since the credit is going to flow according to the PAN card particulars furnished in Form 26QB.\n\n\n\nIt is possible to pay the TDS online, or it can also be deposited offline. For this, the physical challenge has to be tendered to an authorized bank that will be updating the particulars on the income tax department&#8217;s website. After depositing the TDS, the TDS certificate has to be downloaded by the buyer in Form No 16B from the Income Tax Department website, and it is to be furnished within 15 days to the seller.\n\n\n\nNil deduction or lower deduction of TDS\n\n\n\nSome TDS provisions allowed the payee to furnish a nil TDS declaration. He can also approach the IT officer for issuing a certificate such that the payer will be able to deduct tax at a nil rate or a lower rate. Nevertheless, no such TDS provision is applicable on immovable property. The buyer must deduct tax mandatorily at source, where the consideration is going to be more than \u20b950 lakhs, in respect of every single set of seller and buyer.\n\n\n\nConsequences in case TDS is not paid\n\n\n\nAccording to the law, it is expected from the buyer to deduct the TDS from the transaction value and submit it duly with the government. The buyers in the documents can use PAN details since it is not compulsory to have a TAN in their case. If the buyers cannot pay the TDS within the specified time period to the government, they might be required to pay the penalty in the form of interest, or they might likewise be sentenced to laborious imprisonment of as much as 7 years. It is important to keep in mind that although the seller might be compelled to make the payment, the buyer and none else would face the penalty.\n\n\n\nEssential things to bear in mind regarding TDS\n\n\n\nIt is imperative for the buyers to deduct and pay TDS to the authorities on the property whose value happens to be more than 50 lakhs. The buyer has to bear the responsibility of deducting and submitting the TDS instead of the seller. The buyer has to answer to the authorities in the event of any misappropriation in this regard. It is imperative for the buyers to fill Form 26QB for crediting the TDS. Separate forms will be needed to be filled for every single party if there are several sellers or buyers involved in the transaction.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nAll individuals that are making investments for purchasing immovable property apart from rural agricultural land whose value is \u20b950 lakhs or even more ought to comprehend their obligations meticulously for deducting income tax at a 1% rate from the payment which has been made to the seller when it comes to purchasing properties on or after June 1, 2013. Moreover, one can download the TDS certificate from TRACES.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\nSection 194IA of Income Tax Act &amp; its TDS implications on Property PurchaseTax Deduction at Source (TDS) while buying a property in IndiaTips on buying property at auctionsTax deduction at Source (TDS) while buying a property in India from an NRITDS provisions on rent paid, under the income tax laws\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n\n        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhat should be done by me as a buyer in case I don\u2019t have the seller\u2019s PAN?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe PAN of the seller is compulsory for filing Form 26QB and deducting TDS on the property.

            "content_html": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The income tax laws in India entitle all asset holders to share a part of their revenue with the administering government. If you happen to be enjoying residential accommodation, you cannot do away with income tax on house property. In this regard, some commonly related concepts are building tax, land tax, property tax, etc. Though the concepts are closely related to one another, they are not the same.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We will be highlighting some facts that property holders need a close insight into. We will emphasize on topics such as property tax base in India, property tax rebate in India, and many more. As a taxpayer, you ought to be aware of your rights and liabilities. That is all we aim to fulfill by the end of this blog post.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Building tax differentiated from other similar concepts </strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Terms such as building tax, property tax, the land tax might appear similar to you, but is it so? The context in which such terminologies are used in India makes them different from one another. Property tax is a simpler concept, and it resembles the annual tax paid to the local authority within whose jurisdiction your property lies. On the other hand, land tax is the tax paid owing to ownership of bare real estate property.&nbsp; However, the implication and context of building tax are completely separated from the others.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Building tax is calculated on your annual income, from which the tax gets deducted depending on the category of income your earnings fall under. As an owner of a property, if or not you are entitled to any profits out of it, you need to part with the government as its revenue. That is exactly what is termed as income tax on house property. The mere existence of ownership of a property and its benefits entitles you to pay taxes as responsible citizens.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What are the different categories of buildings for which tax can be charged?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are primarily three types of usages of a building. It can either be a residential building, a commercial building, or a building used for institutional purposes. Each category has a different capability to generate revenue which further interferes with the amount of tax you need to pay. Besides, there lies about other multiple subheads under which category a particular building might fall. Depending on these factors, building tax is often accounted for. It is mostly the residential building paying the least taxes and the commercial buildings paying the most taxes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Modes of calculating building tax</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The civic bodies scattered in different parts of India usually opt for three typical modes of calculating taxes. Let\u2019s take a look at how the procedure is conducted:</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li><strong>Capital value system (CVS):</strong> It is perhaps the simplest mode of calculations fixed by the government itself. Under this system, the market value of the property is the key consideration. Such market value differs as you move from one location to the other. Based on the locality, such value is determined by the government. Mumbai is one such city that has adopted such a valuation method.</li>\n<li><strong>Unit area value system (UAVS):</strong> The name in itself suggests a rough picture for the audience. Under the UAV system, the carpet area of the land is a considerable factor. The value per Sq. Ft area is multiplied by the total area of the land that the building is constructed on. States such as Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Delhi, Bengaluru, Patna follow this method of valuation. The unit per area system takes into consideration the position, construction type, and the type of building. These categories play an influential role in determining the per Sq. Ft value of the land in consideration.</li>\n<li><strong>Annual rental value system (ARVS):</strong> Under this system of valuation, it is the presumptive rental capabilities of a property in a year, taking into consideration. The municipal corporation of the jurisdiction determines such a rate based on certain factors that contribute to the rent generating capabilities of the property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These are the various methods that help the civic bodies adjudge taxes for each building. However, there are other equally important factors to be taken into consideration. Some of those factors include locality, market value, proximity to important destinations, etc. All such factors make up for the tax amount you are obligated to pay.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Conditions that exempt tax pay on buildings </strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In India, the provisions for exemption of tax are enjoyed by several categories of buildings that serve the welfare of the country. In a country where the public good is of utmost consideration, such features are often noted. Therefore, here are some examples of the building that enjoy tax exemption: spaces meant for religious purposes, educational establishments, charitable institutions, ancient/historical monuments, burial/cremation grounds, government land/buildings set out for recreational purposes, trade union association offices, buildings/ lands of urban development authorities established in each state and their acts, establishments providing free medical aid/education and certain specific vacant land/ buildings, belongings of war widows and high-importance award winners, properties of foreign embassies and central government, including the residences of significant bureaucrats and politicians.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Penalty/consequence for non-payment </strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Different cities or municipalities have diverse methods of <strong>building tax </strong>collection. However, with the ever-growing issues of illegal constructions, there is a lack of revenue that reaches the government. India has a vast lower income group population, and that perhaps is the reason behind such illegal construction, thus leading to a scarcity of funds for the government. Nevertheless, gone are the days when strict actions and penalties were not charged on people willing to avoid legit tax pay.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lately, the authorities in different states have enacted different methods to deal with repeated offenders. In the initial stage of non-payment, the authorities order cuts on essential connections such as electricity, water, broadband, etc. Depending on the intensity of the case, some might even be entitled to legal constraints for nonpayment. Cities such as Noida and Gurgaon are perfect examples to support such penalty claims. In these cities, properties of long-term defaulters are confiscated as a consequence.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Property law base in India: Its status </strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In India, property tax lies in several folds of categories. The word property has its classifications. It is not just land considered to be property; any improvements made to a particular piece of land falls under the category of a property. Likewise, the government mandates the payment of such a category of taxes. The valuation of such property is bestowed on the local civic body under the jurisdiction of the region. It is primarily the municipal corporations.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The payment of such taxes is carried out either annually or semi-annually, depending on each region. It is an excellent source of revenue for the government to build up the local amenities for the public good. From expenses on road repairs to maintenance of public places like parks, hospitals, etc., are undertaken by the government based on these taxes. The tax payable is differently applied in different places, and it all depends on the location, connection with amenities, etc.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Can tax be charged on vacant spaces?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In India, there are no particular norms to entitle a house owner to pay <strong>vacant building tax. </strong>However, when it comes down to <strong>property tax, </strong>there is no consideration of whether you have a construction or not. Every landowner is annually entitled to pay such <strong>property tax. </strong>But, over the past few decades, there has been a change in perceiving the high-value resources. Several states have adopted the system of charging <strong>vacant land tax. </strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">States such as Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and even the Union Territory of Delhi fall under the purview of such a newly implemented scheme. The principle behind such implementation is to preserve wasting resources that are of high value to the nation. In the state of Tamil Nadu, the valuation of <strong>vacant land tax </strong>is calculated on the basis of per Sq. Ft area and its proximity to important areas. Likewise, different implementing states have their recourse in calculating the tax valuation of a vacant property.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Likewise, in Hyderabad, the state legislature is such that any vacant land which is not used for agricultural, or occupation purposes will have to pay a tax. The amount of tax payable is about 0.05% of the total valuation of the plot. There is variation when we move to Punjab. In Punjab, too, the state legislations were amended, and taxes were levied on unproductive spaces. It is chargeable at 0.2% of the yearly valuation of the property.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Online payment basics of building tax </strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The 21<sup>st</sup> century calls for easy access to the internet. Similarly, today, one can choose to opt for online payment of taxes. Municipal corporations enable property taxpayers to avail themselves of the online mode of payment. Almost all megacities, along with certain comparatively smaller cities, have opted for online mode of payment through debit/credit card or even net banking. Once you enroll yourself with the official portal, you are all good to go.

            "content_text": "The income tax laws in India entitle all asset holders to share a part of their revenue with the administering government. If you happen to be enjoying residential accommodation, you cannot do away with income tax on house property. In this regard, some commonly related concepts are building tax, land tax, property tax, etc. Though the concepts are closely related to one another, they are not the same.\nWe will be highlighting some facts that property holders need a close insight into. We will emphasize on topics such as property tax base in India, property tax rebate in India, and many more. As a taxpayer, you ought to be aware of your rights and liabilities. That is all we aim to fulfill by the end of this blog post.\nBuilding tax differentiated from other similar concepts \nTerms such as building tax, property tax, the land tax might appear similar to you, but is it so? The context in which such terminologies are used in India makes them different from one another. Property tax is a simpler concept, and it resembles the annual tax paid to the local authority within whose jurisdiction your property lies. On the other hand, land tax is the tax paid owing to ownership of bare real estate property.&nbsp; However, the implication and context of building tax are completely separated from the others.\nBuilding tax is calculated on your annual income, from which the tax gets deducted depending on the category of income your earnings fall under. As an owner of a property, if or not you are entitled to any profits out of it, you need to part with the government as its revenue. That is exactly what is termed as income tax on house property. The mere existence of ownership of a property and its benefits entitles you to pay taxes as responsible citizens.\nWhat are the different categories of buildings for which tax can be charged?\nThere are primarily three types of usages of a building. It can either be a residential building, a commercial building, or a building used for institutional purposes. Each category has a different capability to generate revenue which further interferes with the amount of tax you need to pay. Besides, there lies about other multiple subheads under which category a particular building might fall. Depending on these factors, building tax is often accounted for. It is mostly the residential building paying the least taxes and the commercial buildings paying the most taxes.\nModes of calculating building tax\nThe civic bodies scattered in different parts of India usually opt for three typical modes of calculating taxes. Let\u2019s take a look at how the procedure is conducted:\n\nCapital value system (CVS): It is perhaps the simplest mode of calculations fixed by the government itself. Under this system, the market value of the property is the key consideration. Such market value differs as you move from one location to the other. Based on the locality, such value is determined by the government. Mumbai is one such city that has adopted such a valuation method.\nUnit area value system (UAVS): The name in itself suggests a rough picture for the audience. Under the UAV system, the carpet area of the land is a considerable factor. The value per Sq. Ft area is multiplied by the total area of the land that the building is constructed on. States such as Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Delhi, Bengaluru, Patna follow this method of valuation. The unit per area system takes into consideration the position, construction type, and the type of building. These categories play an influential role in determining the per Sq. Ft value of the land in consideration.\nAnnual rental value system (ARVS): Under this system of valuation, it is the presumptive rental capabilities of a property in a year, taking into consideration. The municipal corporation of the jurisdiction determines such a rate based on certain factors that contribute to the rent generating capabilities of the property.\n\nThese are the various methods that help the civic bodies adjudge taxes for each building. However, there are other equally important factors to be taken into consideration. Some of those factors include locality, market value, proximity to important destinations, etc. All such factors make up for the tax amount you are obligated to pay.\nConditions that exempt tax pay on buildings \nIn India, the provisions for exemption of tax are enjoyed by several categories of buildings that serve the welfare of the country. In a country where the public good is of utmost consideration, such features are often noted. Therefore, here are some examples of the building that enjoy tax exemption: spaces meant for religious purposes, educational establishments, charitable institutions, ancient/historical monuments, burial/cremation grounds, government land/buildings set out for recreational purposes, trade union association offices, buildings/ lands of urban development authorities established in each state and their acts, establishments providing free medical aid/education and certain specific vacant land/ buildings, belongings of war widows and high-importance award winners, properties of foreign embassies and central government, including the residences of significant bureaucrats and politicians.\nPenalty/consequence for non-payment \nDifferent cities or municipalities have diverse methods of building tax collection. However, with the ever-growing issues of illegal constructions, there is a lack of revenue that reaches the government. India has a vast lower income group population, and that perhaps is the reason behind such illegal construction, thus leading to a scarcity of funds for the government. Nevertheless, gone are the days when strict actions and penalties were not charged on people willing to avoid legit tax pay.\nLately, the authorities in different states have enacted different methods to deal with repeated offenders. In the initial stage of non-payment, the authorities order cuts on essential connections such as electricity, water, broadband, etc. Depending on the intensity of the case, some might even be entitled to legal constraints for nonpayment. Cities such as Noida and Gurgaon are perfect examples to support such penalty claims. In these cities, properties of long-term defaulters are confiscated as a consequence.\nProperty law base in India: Its status \nIn India, property tax lies in several folds of categories. The word property has its classifications. It is not just land considered to be property; any improvements made to a particular piece of land falls under the category of a property. Likewise, the government mandates the payment of such a category of taxes. The valuation of such property is bestowed on the local civic body under the jurisdiction of the region. It is primarily the municipal corporations.\nThe payment of such taxes is carried out either annually or semi-annually, depending on each region. It is an excellent source of revenue for the government to build up the local amenities for the public good. From expenses on road repairs to maintenance of public places like parks, hospitals, etc., are undertaken by the government based on these taxes. The tax payable is differently applied in different places, and it all depends on the location, connection with amenities, etc.\nCan tax be charged on vacant spaces?\nIn India, there are no particular norms to entitle a house owner to pay vacant building tax. However, when it comes down to property tax, there is no consideration of whether you have a construction or not. Every landowner is annually entitled to pay such property tax. But, over the past few decades, there has been a change in perceiving the high-value resources. Several states have adopted the system of charging vacant land tax. \nStates such as Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and even the Union Territory of Delhi fall under the purview of such a newly implemented scheme. The principle behind such implementation is to preserve wasting resources that are of high value to the nation. In the state of Tamil Nadu, the valuation of vacant land tax is calculated on the basis of per Sq. Ft area and its proximity to important areas. Likewise, different implementing states have their recourse in calculating the tax valuation of a vacant property.\nLikewise, in Hyderabad, the state legislature is such that any vacant land which is not used for agricultural, or occupation purposes will have to pay a tax. The amount of tax payable is about 0.05% of the total valuation of the plot. There is variation when we move to Punjab. In Punjab, too, the state legislations were amended, and taxes were levied on unproductive spaces. It is chargeable at 0.2% of the yearly valuation of the property.\nOnline payment basics of building tax \nThe 21st century calls for easy access to the internet. Similarly, today, one can choose to opt for online payment of taxes. Municipal corporations enable property taxpayers to avail themselves of the online mode of payment. Almost all megacities, along with certain comparatively smaller cities, have opted for online mode of payment through debit/credit card or even net banking. Once you enroll yourself with the official portal, you are all good to go. However, for the registration procedure, one needs to put in both personal and property details.\nPost-registration, all you need to do is provide some identification details and relevant documents to initiate the payment. One can make payment via the prescribed modes and acquire a challan printout for future reference.&nbsp;\nConclusion\nOwning a property ensures payment of taxes as per the prescription of the legislation. However, a property tax rebate in India can be allowed when the intention behind acquiring the property is public good and welfare. Non-payment, too, can lead to a situation that is not likely suited for most. Hence, as responsible citizens, it is part of our responsibility to fulfill the mandated legal norms.\nMoreover, the government&#8217;s expenses are run from the payment made by taxpayers, and a compromise on that would lead to malfunction. Thus, ensuring the complete safety of your land and property in the public records is a must. And paying building tax gives you the liberty to enjoy your property holding at its best forms.\nFor any more updates on real estate availability and purchase, do visit the Square Yards homepage.\n\n        \n            \n\t\t\t\tDoes the central government decide the amount of tax levied?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tNo, the central government has no role to play in this regard.

            "content_html": "\n<p>Mutating an estate or a plot is a compulsory method in all official proceedings including the property. Change in title/ownership becomes necessary for determining the tax liability at the time of the equity ownership getting changed. By the mutation of land, an individual can get the justice of the land. To bypass the dispute over the title of the land, the change in ownership name is performed by each of the parties that are the buyer as well as the seller.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A mutation requires to be transferred in all matters of estate title alterations such as replacing or buying of assets, the loss of the estate owner, and also a possession made through control of the Attorney. By performing the mutation procedure, the new owner obtains the title of the assets listed in their name in the property revenue department and allows the Government to impose a property tax. Mutation becomes necessary for determining the tax obligation when the estate proprietor is changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Land Mutation in Bihar</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/property-mutation-everything-you-need-to-know\">Mutatio</a>n of capital is the modification or change of ownership/title from an individual to another when the estate is sold or assigned to some other person. By mutating an estate, the latest owner receives the ownership of the property listed in his or her title in the estate revenue department, and the administration of Bihar (the official responsible for Bihar land mutation). The variation in title ownership might occur because of many reasons such as the loss of the original owner and transferring the land to the new owner due to inheritance. In the event of rented property, the title can be given through a certain power of attorney.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>When is the mutation of the land or the property required?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The land mutation is required depending upon the type of land and the change of title/ownership. The mutation is necessary for determining the tax liability when the owner of the property/estate is changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-mutation-is-of-two-types\"><strong>The Mutation is of two types:</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Mutation of Agricultural lands</li><li>Mutation of Non-agricultural lands</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mutation of Agricultural lands</strong> \u2013 A mutation is necessary when the case is about the agricultural lands. One cannot transfer the land ownership/title if the procedure of the mutation is not followed. In the revenue records, the owner&#8217;s name and the mutation need to be entered.

This establishes your legality to carry out any transaction. Only when a property has been registered in the name of a person, he or she is regarded as the legal owner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you fail to register the property, it will be assumed that the former owner or the builder is the legal and lawful owner. Legally, a property transaction isn&#8217;t deemed complete until the sale deed is properly stamped and registered. The main goal of registration is to keep track of who owns the property.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The seller of the asset is known as the &#8220;transferor,&#8221; while the buyer is known as the &#8220;transferee.&#8221; Stamp duty and registration fees are paid by the property buyer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the Registration Act of 1908, a property must be registered for the purposes of sale, transfer, gift, or lease. All agreements involving the sale of immovable property for more than \u20b9100 must be registered, according to Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908. If a person does not register a property while engaging in the aforementioned transactions, the transaction won\u2019t be approved in a legal proceeding.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-section-25-of-the-bihar-registration-act\"><strong>Section 25 of the Bihar Registration Act</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The paperwork required for registering a property deed must be sent to the relevant Registrar official within four months after the date of property registration, according to Section 25 of the Bihar Registration Act. In the event of a violation of the foregoing, a fine of up to 10 times the amount of the property registration fee is applied.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-advantages-of-online-property-registration-in-bihar\"><strong>The Advantages of Online Property Registration in Bihar</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By registering the property deed, you may take advantage of the following benefits:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Offer assurance that the deed is genuine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Ensure that the prevention of fraud, the preservation of evidence, and the transfer of ownership to the owner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Make transactions more evident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Registering a property allows you to keep an up-to-date public record.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 To be able to detect whether or not the property has previously been sold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 To present security of title deeds in the event that the original deeds are lost or damaged.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-happens-if-you-don-t-register-your-property\"><strong>What happens if you don&#8217;t register your property?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The documentations will have no impact on the property and will neither provide any property rights nor any benefits of land registration in Bihar. In other terms, the purchaser will be treated by the law as an unacknowledged owner with no rights to the property.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-property-registration-in-bihar\"><strong>Property Registration in Bihar</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The terms describing the presentation of documentation for registration by a person are defined in Section 32 of the Registration Act of 1908.

            "content_html": "<p>The <strong>Reserve Bank of India</strong> decides on releasing liquidity into the Indian economy. Since the first wave of the pandemic<strong>, RBI</strong> kept regulating its policy rates<strong>. At A Time When Loan Sanctions Have Remained Muted on Risk Concerns Despite an Uptick in Home Loan-Related Inquiries</strong>, RBI decided on keeping <strong>lending rate</strong> low. <strong>RBI </strong>kept its <strong>repo rate</strong> unchanged to as low as 4%, thus enabling its subsidiary scheduled banks in India to release <strong>home </strong><strong>loans</strong> at a lower <strong>interest rate</strong>.</p>\n<p>To provide relief to the housing sector, the finance minister announced an <strong>alternative investment fund for real estate</strong>. It was released at <strong>25000 Cr Package for Real Estate </strong>to the housing projects withheld due to lack of funds. The <strong>relief package for real estate </strong>acted as a major saviour for the whole industry, which has a huge multiplier impact in providing jobs to millions of populations in the country.\u00a0 Both these major steps taken by the government helped keep the economy stable. As the second-largest industry contributing to the Indian economy, the real estate sector demanded such strong steps.</p>\n<h2><strong>Unchanged repo rate: impact on home loans </strong></h2>\n<p>The <strong>monetary policy committee</strong> of the <strong>RBI</strong> fourth time in a row initiated keeping the <strong>repo rate</strong> and reverse repo rate unchanged. It was scheduled at 4% to 3.35% respectively. Owing to the situation, the commercial banks could now lend money from the central bank at low rates. This would entitle the banks to allow more credit to the <strong>home loan</strong> borrowers at a <strong>low</strong><strong>-interest rate</strong>. The move&#8217;s significance would further entitle the loan borrowers to pay lesser EMI than usually settled for.</p>\n<p>There was a hike in demand for home loans amidst the pandemic, and to meet such a demand, the unchanged <strong>repo rate </strong>threw light on the need for an adequate supply of funds. With that, not just the borrowers, the FD investors were also seen in an advantageous position. The different commercial banks could now no longer be arbitrary with the interest rates. Some significant analysts considered experts in the field of real estate have observed this move of the central bank to bring about improvements in the economy.</p>\n<p>As of November 2020, the <strong>interest</strong> <strong>rate </strong>of some of the major banks is Union Bank 6.70%, Bank of India 6.85%, Central Bank of India 6.85%, Punjab and Sind Bank 6.90%, Canara Bank 6.90%, SBI 6.90%, PNB 6.80%, HDFC Bank 6.90%, ICICI Bank 6.90%, Bank of Baroda 7.00%, Bank of India 6.85%.</p>\n<h2><strong>Impact of RBI&#8217;s linking of risk-weightage factor to LTV only.</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>RBI</strong>\u2019s guidelines on reframing the risk-weightage norms were another boon for the real estate sector. The home borrowers were all in a win-win situation. Previously before the initiation of the central bank, the risk weightage factors were mainly two. Namely, the weightage of the loan and LTV ratio. However, the new norms of the regulatory policy mention the risk weightage factor to be related to the LTV ratio only. Any <strong>Home loan </strong>approved up to 31<sup>st</sup> March 2020 will be benefited from this new policy.</p>\n<p>In cases where the LTV was as high as 80%, the risk weightage would be 35%, and for cases where LTV goes beyond 80%, the risk weightage will lie at 50%. Real estate as the second-largest employment-generating arena needed the attention and care that the central bank and the government tried to provide amidst the reckoning of the second wave of corona pandemic.</p>\n<p>To the guidelines of the regulatory body, several economists threw light on the advantages of the same. The benefit is none other than maintaining employment in the sector as much as possible. Also, the home borrowers had a great chance to fulfill their dreams of owning a house.</p>\n<h2><strong>RBI\u2019S 3-month Moratorium announcement on home loan </strong></h2>\n<p>With the coronavirus outbreak, its repercussions on the economy were tremendous. To revive the economy, the apex regulatory financial authority decided on granting temporary relief for the existing <strong>home loan </strong>buyers. Thus, a moratorium was announced by the central bank on 27<sup>th</sup> March 2020. As per the guidelines, the failure of parties to pay loan installment would not lead it to be seen as a &#8216;non-performing asset.&#8217;</p>\n<p>It was a guideline that was allowed for the other banks in India to follow. This massive step was a true spirit to check on those suffering from a lack of liquidity. The financial crunch that the pandemic has brought is not worth comparing. However, such efforts by the <strong>monetary policy committee </strong>of the <strong>reserve bank of India </strong>is an active method. With the end of the moratorium, it was noted that the number of applicants was huge, and thus we can say the guidelines were effective in their true terms and spirit.</p>\n<h2><strong>RBI changes its cash reserve ratio (CRP) norms to promote lending by the banks </strong></h2>\n<p>CRP, or the cash reserve ratio, is the cash reserve deposits by commercial banks to the apex regulatory body. Thus, with the aim to promote/encourage lending of housing loans by the commercial banks, the Reserve Bank decided on an incentive policy. According to the policy announced on 6<sup>th</sup> February 2020, relaxations were granted to calculate total deposits by commercial banks.\u00a0 The commercial banks could avail as much incentive depending on the increased amount of lending.</p>\n<p>The sole purpose behind such a proposal was to help the targeted groups in the real estate sector. The target group under the incentive scheme included residential housing, small, micro, and medium enterprises, and retail automobile loans. The validity of the incremental process was made applicable till 31<sup>st</sup> of July 20220. The exemption was allowed for about 4% of the total deposits of each commercial bank with the <strong>RBI</strong>.</p>\n<h2><strong>Stress fund for Ghaziabad: CREDAI </strong></h2>\n<p>On 19<sup>th</sup> November 2019, Ghaziabad, President of CREDAI, brought to the point that about 4050 projects were entitled to be benefitted from the central government&#8217;s scheme. Most housing projects in Ghaziabad were delayed by approximately 2 to 3 years. About 14000 home buyers who were awaiting their respective deliveries could be compensated out of the scheme.</p>\n<p>The president suggested changing the law whereby the home buyers could be prevented from initiating legal proceedings against respective real estate contractors. Also, he suggested that the point of contact between home buyers and their assets should be the RERA (real estate regulatory authority) instead of the consumer forum. These were the few considerations that depict the applicability of the government schemes and guidelines.</p>\n<h2><strong>Central governments alternative investment fund for the real estate sector </strong></h2>\n<p>The demand for housing and similarly related projects was at its peak. However, the supply was not adequate to meet the growing needs. Owing to a lack of funds, housing projects in the real estate sector were pending. The situation was taken under consideration, and Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman came up with a <strong>25000 Cr Package for Real Estate. </strong>The purpose behind the scheme was to identify and meet the needs of genuine projects that seek assistance.</p>\n<p>Along with real estate contractors, the scheme was also aimed at assisting finance companies and banks. Apart from net-worth positive projects, it will also help revive or restart the projects termed as non-performing assets and those pending litigation under NCLT. Any project suffering from liquidity or credit availability issues was meant to be benefited out of the scheme of the central government.</p>\n<p>The scheme was to be disposed of unit-wise. The <strong>real estate AIF</strong> provided funds to pending real estate projects with a unit size of lower than Rs 2 crore in metro cities and Rs 1 crore in other smaller places. Out of the remaining, Rs 10,000 crores were awarded to SBI and Life Insurance Corporation (LIC). Also, any project beyond the purview of registration with the real estate regulatory authority will be kept away from the benefits of the scheme. The minimum value for each project was set at Rs 400 crores.</p>\n<p>The scheme was none other than a renewed version of the 14<sup>th of</sup> September 2019 \u201cspecial window\u201d plan. The new plan targeted to meet the needs of over 4.58 lakh housing units spread all over the country. The strategy behind the dispensation of the scheme was commendable as the union government reached out to the top two lenders in the country.</p>\n<h2><strong>Developers welcoming relief package for real estate with open arms </strong></h2>\n<p>With the <strong>real estate AIF, </strong>the government made up a full-proof plan to kick start the second largest sector in India. While cutting down restrictions on the deplorability of funds, the government was assured that funds would reach the right place for the right target. <strong>Jaxay Shah, </strong>the CREDAI chairman, threw light on the same. Now, by enabling the scheme, home buyers and real estate contractors could resume their long-stuck work if it happens to be net worth positive.</p>\n<p>Most economists and potential people associated with the industry reflected on the fact that the move of the union government played the role of watering the plants of the real estate sector. The ultimate goal of promoting housing and retaining employability in the real estate sector was accomplished.</p>\n<h2><strong>Concluding lines </strong></h2>\n<p>To secure financial stability, the financial regulatory authority and the Union government came up with an umpty number of policies and schemes. All its efforts were directed towards securing employment structure along with promoting housing at low rates amidst the pandemic. From cutting down the repo<strong> rate </strong>and incentives on CRP, and the <strong>alternative investment fund, </strong>all of it forms part of the success story.</p>\n<p>There was a welcoming attitude observed out of the experts and economists likewise.

How much should you be paying for your property taxes? The point to remember here is that the amount will vary from state to state, city to city, and sometimes even from municipality to municipality, but that is hardly ever the case. Every city more or less has a plan of collecting taxes and they are done mostly through 3 systems. In one system the property tax is collected based on the market value of the property.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This form of calculation is seen in <a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/mumbai-real-estate\">Mumbai</a>, which is why maintaining your property in Mumbai is an expensive affair. In other cases, the calculation is done based on the per sqft value of the property, as we see in Kolkata. There is also a third system in which the calculation of the property tax is done based on the rentable value of the property. What this means is that how much rent would the property fetch, if it is rented \u2013 the calculation is done based on that. The property does not need to be rented. In all three systems, the property tax is to be paid by the one who owns it, not by the person who has rented it. So, how does the <strong>PCMC property tax online</strong>\u00a0make its calculations?\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The PCMC calculates its property tax values following the same one as in Mumbai. So, it calculates the property tax amount on the ready reckoner value which is determined by the market value of the property. So the amount is calculated based on that. So, this is a calculation that you can do for yourself as well. Let\u2019s find out how.\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>First, you will have to visit the\u00a0https://www.pcmcindia.gov.in/ptax_calc/index.html</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Over here, you will have to enter the zone for which you want to calculate the taxes, like say whether it is residential, NRI, etc.\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have selected the zone, you will have to select the sub-use type, like what kind of property it is, where the property is, etc.\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With that done, your property tax will be calculated automatically.\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This is known as self-assessment which can be done before the\u00a0<strong>PCMC property tax payment</strong>. If you get the self-assessment done, then you will be able to know from beforehand, how much tax do you need to pay and you can prepare yourself accordingly as well. This is necessary for you to be prepared and since it can be done online, it is hassle-free.\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do We Have Rebates On Property Taxes?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>While every property owner will have to pay property taxes, there are different kinds of rebates as well which one can enjoy when it comes to them. These rebates or discounts are dependent on a lot of factors. The Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation has its own set of rebates. Let\u2019s take a look at the various\u00a0<strong>PCMC property tax</strong>\u00a0rebates one can enjoy:\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you have a residential property or a plot of land or a non-residential property then you can also apply for rebates. You will get a 10% discount on the general tax being paid if the rateable value of the property is within Rs.25,000/-. If the rateable value is more than Rs. 25,000/-, then you will be eligible for a discount of 5%. The PCMC has a very interesting rebate method for environmentally friendly and conscious households as well. If you have solar power or practice rainwater harvesting or vermiculture, at your residence, then you will get a rebate of 5%-10%. The percentage of rebate on the <strong>PCMC property tax payment</strong>\u00a0will be decided by how many eco-friendly projects as mentioned before, is there at your residence.\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>There are a few types of properties that do not have to pay any property tax at all. Let\u2019s take a look at the list of such properties:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Public burial grounds</li>\r\n<li>Places of religious worship</li>\r\n<li>Educational institutes</li>\r\n<li>Crematorium\u00a0</li>\r\n<li>Heritage land</li>\r\n<li>Charitable organizations</li>\r\n<li>Agricultural lands</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>These are some of the basic pointers that one needs to keep in mind when it comes to the\u00a0<strong>PCMC property tax</strong>. But there are a few other important pointers that you need to bear in mind as well.\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Changing Ownership and How to Change the Name?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now, suppose there is a change in ownership of the property land. Then you will have to transfer the name of the owner from the old one to the new one. Now, how will you go about that process? It is also quite a simple one and can be processed if you have some of the basic documents in order. Let us find out how that is done.\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>First and foremost, there is a list of documents that you will need to have, which if you go about the process in the right manner, you will have with you. First, you will need a receipt of the last paid property tax. You will also require a no-objection form from the housing society stating and acknowledging the ownership transfer. This will not be required in the case of individual house ownership transfer for <strong>PCMC property tax payment</strong>. You will also need the sale deed. The sale deed needs to be in order, which states that the owner of the property is you, the applicant, not the previous owner. You will also need to collect the application form for name transfer from the PCMC office.\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have all the documents, their copies attested and the application form filled out, you will need to submit it to the Commissioner of Revenue, who sits at the PCMC office. Just to be on the safe side, make sure that you have a Xerox copy of the entire set of the application with yourself as a record that you have submitted it.\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Special Rebates for Women</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation offers a concession on property tax for women. It was on 8th March 2011, that this is announcement was made and the concession put in place. Women do get a lot of concessions when it comes to property ownership and transfer and this was just another step to make the process easier for them because for women to rise and claim ownership in the first place is a rather difficult proposition. So, how do the <strong>PCMC property tax online</strong>\u00a0grant concessions?\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>First and foremost, a woman has to be the owner of the property.\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To inform the municipal corporation that one is eligible for the rebate, one will have to fill out a particular form known as the MAHILA REBATE PROPERTY FORM. This form is available online at\u00a0https://www.pcmcindia.gov.in/ptax_forms.php</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have downloaded and filled out the form, you will then need to get a stamp paper of Rs.100/- to get it verified and submit it along with the form.\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It will be processed with a period of 2-3 weeks and if all the documents are found to be in order, then one will start enjoying the rebates from the next cycle of\u00a0<strong>PCMC property tax online payment</strong>. It is best that when you are applying for this concession, you do not sit on your application for long. Get it done as soon as possible and if there is any difficulty in processing it, get it sorted. So it is best that you file the application way ahead of the payment cycle. It is also important to note here that, the woman in whose name the property is, has to have no pending civic dues.\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This brings us to another important question \u2013</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What happens when you have a payment default?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Well, though it is not at all advisable, sometimes people do forget to file their\u00a0<strong>PCMC property tax</strong>. What can you do when you have not filed for or even paid your taxes? Well, you will have to clear your dues in the next cycle and it is best that you do it as early as possible. It is important to remember here that in case of payment defaults you will attract penalties, a sum which you will have to pay while paying the dues. So, when you have a default, you will have to end up paying way more than your usual property tax rate, and what is the point in doing that? You will have to fill out forms stating your default payment and then submit it and file for a late submission. It is an unnecessary hassle that can be avoided. So, how can you save yourself from being late with the payments?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To begin with, you will have to set a reminder. If you have an agent who looks after these matters, remind him to remind you, so that you do not miss out on the date. Self-assessment dates end before the last date of\u00a0<strong>PCMC property tax online payment</strong>, so you need to keep a track of that too. It is best that you be systematic about this and not deal with it lightly. Defaulting will put a strain on your pocket, hence it is best to avoid it as much as possible. And when you are transferring a property to your name right before the tax payment cycle, make sure that your last owner pays it or you can negotiate with them and sort out the details. Do not miss out on that.\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So, now that you have all the information that you need when it comes to\u00a0<strong>PCMC property tax</strong>, be very particular about filing it, and do not miss out on the most important steps.\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"222\" class=\"wp-image-20570\" src=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-125.png\" alt=\"pcmc property tax online payment\r\n\" srcset=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-125.png 624w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-125-300x107.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" /></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><strong>FAQs</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>What is the value or meaning of property taxes?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Property tax supports local bodies with supplies to give you economic services such as sweeping the area, a decent supply of water, preservation of roads, sewerage, etc. It also benefits you in the state of any estate dispute to confirm your ownership of the property.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Is property tax relevant to vacant areas or property? </strong></p>\r\n<p>Property tax implements any type of vacant property unless the land is utilized only for farming purposes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Which real estate properties are spared from the property taxes?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Any property that is utilized for religious offering, public funeral, burial, and cultural land is excluded from the property tax.

Now, this payment needs to be made on an annual or semi-annual basis to the PCMC or the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation. This is the municipal corporation for Pune and it is considered to be one of the richest in the country, after the one in Mumbai. Pune is a residential area primarily, or rather it developed into one with time and hence the need for a separate municipal corporation, to keep things in order. So, whenever you pay your property tax you pay it through the\u00a0PCMC property tax online payment.\u00a0                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhat Happens With The Revenue Collected From Property Taxes?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe money that is collected from the property taxes is generally used for various civic welfare amenities, like repairing parks and road, beautification, etc. So basically, the money that you pay as your property tax is used for your civic benefits.\u00a0                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Much Property Tax Should I Pay?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, this is a very important question. How much should you be paying for your property taxes? The point to remember here is that the amount will vary from state to state, city to city, and sometimes even from municipality to municipality, but that is hardly ever the case. Every city more or less has a plan of collecting taxes and they are done mostly through 3 systems. In one system the property tax is collected based on the market value of the property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis form of calculation is seen in Mumbai, which is why maintaining your property in Mumbai is an expensive affair. In other cases, the calculation is done based on the per sqft value of the property, as we see in Kolkata. There is also a third system in which the calculation of the property tax is done based on the rentable value of the property. What this means is that how much rent would the property fetch, if it is rented \u2013 the calculation is done based on that. The property does not need to be rented. In all three systems, the property tax is to be paid by the one who owns it, not by the person who has rented it. So, how does the PCMC property tax online\u00a0make its calculations?\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PCMC calculates its property tax values following the same one as in Mumbai. So, it calculates the property tax amount on the ready reckoner value which is determined by the market value of the property. So the amount is calculated based on that. So, this is a calculation that you can do for yourself as well. Let\u2019s find out how.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, you will have to visit the\u00a0https://www.pcmcindia.gov.in/ptax_calc/index.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOver here, you will have to enter the zone for which you want to calculate the taxes, like say whether it is residential, NRI, etc.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce you have selected the zone, you will have to select the sub-use type, like what kind of property it is, where the property is, etc.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith that done, your property tax will be calculated automatically.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is known as self-assessment which can be done before the\u00a0PCMC property tax payment. If you get the self-assessment done, then you will be able to know from beforehand, how much tax do you need to pay and you can prepare yourself accordingly as well. This is necessary for you to be prepared and since it can be done online, it is hassle-free.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo We Have Rebates On Property Taxes?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile every property owner will have to pay property taxes, there are different kinds of rebates as well which one can enjoy when it comes to them. These rebates or discounts are dependent on a lot of factors. The Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation has its own set of rebates. Let\u2019s take a look at the various\u00a0PCMC property tax\u00a0rebates one can enjoy:\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have a residential property or a plot of land or a non-residential property then you can also apply for rebates. You will get a 10% discount on the general tax being paid if the rateable value of the property is within Rs.25,000/-. If the rateable value is more than Rs. 25,000/-, then you will be eligible for a discount of 5%. The PCMC has a very interesting rebate method for environmentally friendly and conscious households as well. If you have solar power or practice rainwater harvesting or vermiculture, at your residence, then you will get a rebate of 5%-10%. The percentage of rebate on the PCMC property tax payment\u00a0will be decided by how many eco-friendly projects as mentioned before, is there at your residence.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a few types of properties that do not have to pay any property tax at all. Let\u2019s take a look at the list of such properties:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic burial grounds\r\nPlaces of religious worship\r\nEducational institutes\r\nCrematorium\u00a0\r\nHeritage land\r\nCharitable organizations\r\nAgricultural lands\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are some of the basic pointers that one needs to keep in mind when it comes to the\u00a0PCMC property tax. But there are a few other important pointers that you need to bear in mind as well.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChanging Ownership and How to Change the Name?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, suppose there is a change in ownership of the property land. Then you will have to transfer the name of the owner from the old one to the new one. Now, how will you go about that process? It is also quite a simple one and can be processed if you have some of the basic documents in order. Let us find out how that is done.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, there is a list of documents that you will need to have, which if you go about the process in the right manner, you will have with you. First, you will need a receipt of the last paid property tax. You will also require a no-objection form from the housing society stating and acknowledging the ownership transfer. This will not be required in the case of individual house ownership transfer for PCMC property tax payment. You will also need the sale deed. The sale deed needs to be in order, which states that the owner of the property is you, the applicant, not the previous owner. You will also need to collect the application form for name transfer from the PCMC office.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce you have all the documents, their copies attested and the application form filled out, you will need to submit it to the Commissioner of Revenue, who sits at the PCMC office. Just to be on the safe side, make sure that you have a Xerox copy of the entire set of the application with yourself as a record that you have submitted it.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial Rebates for Women\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation offers a concession on property tax for women. It was on 8th March 2011, that this is announcement was made and the concession put in place. Women do get a lot of concessions when it comes to property ownership and transfer and this was just another step to make the process easier for them because for women to rise and claim ownership in the first place is a rather difficult proposition. So, how do the PCMC property tax online\u00a0grant concessions?\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, a woman has to be the owner of the property.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo inform the municipal corporation that one is eligible for the rebate, one will have to fill out a particular form known as the MAHILA REBATE PROPERTY FORM. This form is available online at\u00a0https://www.pcmcindia.gov.in/ptax_forms.php\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce you have downloaded and filled out the form, you will then need to get a stamp paper of Rs.100/- to get it verified and submit it along with the form.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be processed with a period of 2-3 weeks and if all the documents are found to be in order, then one will start enjoying the rebates from the next cycle of\u00a0PCMC property tax online payment. It is best that when you are applying for this concession, you do not sit on your application for long. Get it done as soon as possible and if there is any difficulty in processing it, get it sorted. So it is best that you file the application way ahead of the payment cycle. It is also important to note here that, the woman in whose name the property is, has to have no pending civic dues.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis brings us to another important question \u2013\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat happens when you have a payment default?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, though it is not at all advisable, sometimes people do forget to file their\u00a0PCMC property tax. What can you do when you have not filed for or even paid your taxes? Well, you will have to clear your dues in the next cycle and it is best that you do it as early as possible. It is important to remember here that in case of payment defaults you will attract penalties, a sum which you will have to pay while paying the dues. So, when you have a default, you will have to end up paying way more than your usual property tax rate, and what is the point in doing that? You will have to fill out forms stating your default payment and then submit it and file for a late submission. It is an unnecessary hassle that can be avoided. So, how can you save yourself from being late with the payments?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo begin with, you will have to set a reminder. If you have an agent who looks after these matters, remind him to remind you, so that you do not miss out on the date. Self-assessment dates end before the last date of\u00a0PCMC property tax online payment, so you need to keep a track of that too. It is best that you be systematic about this and not deal with it lightly. Defaulting will put a strain on your pocket, hence it is best to avoid it as much as possible. And when you are transferring a property to your name right before the tax payment cycle, make sure that your last owner pays it or you can negotiate with them and sort out the details. Do not miss out on that.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, now that you have all the information that you need when it comes to\u00a0PCMC property tax, be very particular about filing it, and do not miss out on the most important steps.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAQs\u00a0\r\nWhat is the value or meaning of property taxes?\r\nProperty tax supports local bodies with supplies to give you economic services such as sweeping the area, a decent supply of water, preservation of roads, sewerage, etc. It also benefits you in the state of any estate dispute to confirm your ownership of the property.\r\nIs property tax relevant to vacant areas or property? \r\nProperty tax implements any type of vacant property unless the land is utilized only for farming purposes.\r\nWhich real estate properties are spared from the property taxes?\r\nAny property that is utilized for religious offering, public funeral, burial, and cultural land is excluded from the property tax. Any construction that is utilized for charitable, institutional, or farming purposes is also excluded from the property tax.\r\nWho is responsible for paying the Property Tax in the case Of joint ownership?\r\nBoth the landowners are accountable to pay a portion of the property tax as per their shareholding in the real estate property.\r\nHow do I get a discount on PCMC property tax?\r\nIf you have domestic property, land, or commercial property then you can also petition for rebates. You will receive a 10% reduction on the general tax being given if the ratable worth of the estate is inside Rs. 25,000/-.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe post PCMC Property Tax Payment Online appeared first on Real Estate News.",
