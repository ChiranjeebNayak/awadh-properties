            "content_html": "\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The Lakshmi Vilas Palace is one of the most magnificent mansions ever created, set among enormous gardens, mango orchards, and sweeping fields. It was commissioned in 1880 by Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III and is four times the size of Buckingham Palace, with a total area of 700 acres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The magnificent palace, which was completed in about 1890 has been the residence of the Gaekwads, the rulers of the Princely State of Baroda, Gujarat for more than a century. The Palace compound includes numerous additional institutes, including the Baroda Golf Club, the Maharaja Fatehsinhrao Museum, and Motibaug Cricket Grounds, all of which are located inside its enormous property. The palace grounds are so large that they previously hosted a small zoo and a miniature train line to transport the royal children around. Due to the employment of domes, minarets, and arches, the palace is a perfect blend of Hindu, Mughal, and Gothic architectural styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-project-s-doomed-architect\"><strong>The Project&#8217;s Doomed Architect</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The project&#8217;s lead architect Major Charles Mant was a well-known architect during his time. The Lakshmi Vilas was his most ambitious undertaking, having constructed palaces at Darbhanga, Bihar, and Kolhapur. Despite being an enthusiastic architect, he was believed to suffer from melancholy and paranoia, eventually leading to his death midway through the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">His death is said to have been the result of a suicide attempt motivated by fear. There are two theories as to what caused the anxiety or shame that drove him to such extremes. The first claims that he was concerned that his calculations were incorrect, and that the palace might collapse at any moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The other claims that an inverted North symbol on the blueprints caused the palace to be erected in the mirror image of the design. As a result, the palace&#8217;s main entrance is on the backside. In any case, the architect died in the middle of the project, and Robert Fellows Chisolm was hired to take his place. Robert Fellows Chisholm, the designer architect, spent twelve years completing this magnificent edifice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-magnificent-palace\"><strong>The Magnificent Palace</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The palace was constructed for GBP 180,000 and had modern amenities such as elevators, an internal telephone system, and an electricity supply. The mansion was meant to be the most lavish edifice in the Baroda State, using materials sourced from all around the state. Even the building workers were only the best, and in some instances, they were even brought in from overseas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The palace&#8217;s facade is made of golden stone from Songadh mines, which gives it a distinctive golden light when seen in the dark and morning. The palace&#8217;s exterior is adorned with elements such as tiny domed &#8220;chattris&#8221; with finials, cusped arched entries, and jharokha windows, all in the Indo-Saracenic design. The outside is also decorated with finely carved stone patterns, brackets, and bands of carvings and paintings. In addition to these components, it also has a large structure that was supposed to be a clock tower but never turned out to be. Alternatively, a tiny red light was put on it to alert the populace if the monarch was there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Although the exteriors were the focus, the interiors are no less. The interiors are organized around two courtyards with trees and water fountains that quickly transport you to India&#8217;s tropical environment. The pleasant afternoons are provided by the trees and the water fountain, while the regal aspect is contributed by marble statues and cast-iron lamp posts. Aside from that, the interiors have been lavishly adorned with elaborate stucco work, paintings, foreign-made crystal chandeliers, stained glass windows, Venetian floor mosaics, exquisite furniture, and sculptures by Felici, the renowned Italian artist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">This palace has enormous stairs with ornate marble railings and wide long hallways, much like any other palace. The palace is surrounded by these passageways, which give sufficient natural lighting and ventilation. The 170 large and tiny rooms are connected by magnificent stairways and long darkened hallways, some with themes such as the silver room or the gulabi (pink) room. The Darbar Hall is arguably the most remarkable of them, and without even viewing it, one cannot fully appreciate the palace&#8217;s magnificence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>The Darbar Hall:</strong> This great hall, which is approximately 5000 Sq. Ft in size is where the most exquisite music and dance events, as well as the most extravagant feasts, were held. The juxtaposing golden decorations above the arches and the dark brown wooden balconies gazing down from the first floor provide vitality to the hall, which is painted in a pale ivory tone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The intricate Venetian floor mosaic on the double-height hall&#8217;s floor contrasts with geometric designs in green and red on the ceiling. The bright belgian stained glass windows add to the overall effect. When the hall is lighted up with large crystal chandeliers echoing the hues of the ceilings and painting the space in a regal air, the entire design comes together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>The Gaddi Hall:</strong> The Gaddi Hall is famous for housing the throne, which has been occupied by numerous monarchs in the past. An amazing number of beautiful artworks are stitched throughout the extremely huge space. The paintings of Goddess Saraswati, Laxmi, and Lord Krishna, among others, are meticulously placed to create a feeling of harmony and balance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>The Pratap Shastragar:</strong> The Pratap Shastragar, or royal armoury, is located in a visitor-friendly section of the palace. The age-old weaponry that was previously used by the royal family and troops of the Baroda State Army are stored here, behind the enormous glass cases. The Rajratna Prof. Manikrao, the man who renovated the Jummadada Vyayam Mandir, selected this assortment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>The Gardens:</strong> William Goldring, a landscape architect from Kew Gardens, manicured the gardens surrounding the palace. The Sunken Garden, located just outside the mansion, is the most famous of them. Human statues in marble and bronze, as well as decorative marble urns, are scattered around the gardens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>The Gates:</strong> The primary and sole magnificent entrance to the palace is located at the end of the Rajmahal Road, among the many gates allowing access to the many parts of the mansion. The king/royal clan have their own gate, which is equally as impressive as the palace itself. This doorway, like the other gates found in Gaekwadi Era structures, has a centre section with a Bengali roof surrounded by two towers and two smaller entrances topped with domes. The structure is made of the same stone as the castle and is embellished with etchings of animals and ornate patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>A model railway and a zoo:</strong> The mansion formerly had its own miniature railway and zoo. To transport his children from the school to the main Lakshmi Vilas Palace, the King built a small train line that encircled the mango grove within the palace grounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-surroundings-of-the-palace\"><strong>The surroundings of the Palace</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>The Fatehsinhrao Museum: </strong>The Fatehsinhrao Museum was built as a schoolhouse for the king&#8217;s children. The museum now houses a vast collection of works of art belonging to the royal family. The most notable of these is the magnificent collection of Raja Ravi Varma&#8217;s paintings, which were particularly acquired by the Maharaja of Baroda.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The museum is well-known among the locals for hosting the yearly Fort Building Competition and the Ganpati Idol Making Competition, both of which are open to both adults and children.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>The Cricket Association and the Motibaug Palace:</strong> The Motibaug Palace is really a modest structure that precedes the mansion itself. It was originally built during Maharaja Ganpatrao Gaekwad&#8217;s era to accommodate the State&#8217;s architects and engineers. The Gaekwad Baroda Golf Club&#8217;s main club is now housed there. The Moti Bagh Cricket Ground, the administration of the Baroda Cricket Association, and a very unusual indoor teak coated tennis and badminton court are next to the Motibaug Palace and the Museum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>The Golf Club:</strong> Maharaja Pratapsinhrao built a golf course for his European visitors in the 1930s. The course was rebuilt and offered to the general populace in the 1990s by Pratapsinhrao&#8217;s grandson Samarjitsinh, a renowned Ranji Trophy cricket player. The Gaekwad Baroda Golf Club upgraded the course in 2004 into a magnificent course that presently has over 900 members.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>The LVP Banquets:</strong> The LVP Banquets was established a few years ago with a tiny facility comprising of a few large and small halls. The sunken gardens, which are a part of the mansion, are also available for hire by the Banquets for arranging parties and ceremonies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>A massive tree and an ecology: </strong>Over time, the gardens around the palace have acquired their own environment. Around the royal compound, langoors and peacocks may be seen in packs. Aside from that, the complex is home to a massive Banyan tree known as the &#8220;Sayaji Vad,&#8221; which is over a century old and has its own ecology.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-facts-about-lakshmi-vilas-palace\"><strong>Facts about Lakshmi Vilas Palace</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Did you know that it is known to be the world&#8217;s largest private residence?</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The interiors are reminiscent of a large European country house.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It had elevators when it was built, which was unusual.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Prem Rog released in 1982, Dil Hi Toh Hai released in 1993, Sardaar Gabbar Singh released in 2016, and Grand Masti released in 2013, are just a few of the Bollywood films shot in this palace.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-valuation-of-vadodara-s-lakshmi-vilas-palace\"><strong>Valuation of Vadodara&#8217;s Lakshmi Vilas Palace</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III constructed Lakshmi Vilas Palace in 1890 for a staggering \u20b927,00,000 (\u00a31,80,000), which was a considerable sum at that time. The Moti Bagh Cricket Ground, as well as the administration of the well-known Baroda Cricket Association are located near the museum. Navlakhi Vav, a famous stepwell dating from 1405 AD, is also included inside the complex. While it is nearly hard to correctly describe the value of such a massive and intimidating national landmark, estimations suggest that property values in this location might range from \u20b97,000 to \u20b98,000 per Sq. Ft. Taking all into consideration, it is worth noting that the palace compound covers 700 acres or 3,04,92,000 Sq. Ft. Using the current market cost of \u20b98,000 per Sq. Ft as a guide, the ultimate worth would be at least \u20b92,43,93,60,00,000. To put it another way, the Lakshmi Vilas Palace would be valued at a staggering twenty-four thousand three hundred and sixty crores and sixty lakhs. Given the structure&#8217;s cultural significance and history, this figure may potentially reach \u20b925,000 crores.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-ending-remarks\"><strong>Ending Remarks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Overall, the palace is the pinnacle of grandeur and a testament of a king who used to be the world&#8217;s eighth richest man. The palace is one of the greatest examples of Indo-Saracenic architecture, which combines Hindu, Mughal, Rajasthani, and Western design. It is adorned with items by some of the world&#8217;s finest artisans. Last but not least, it is a depiction of the splendour of an Indian princely state. Picture the magnificence of India, which at one time had about 800 similar Princely States.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-you-might-also-like\">You Might Also Like</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul

Human statues in marble and bronze, as well as decorative marble urns, are scattered around the gardens.\n\n\n\nThe Gates: The primary and sole magnificent entrance to the palace is located at the end of the Rajmahal Road, among the many gates allowing access to the many parts of the mansion. The king/royal clan have their own gate, which is equally as impressive as the palace itself. This doorway, like the other gates found in Gaekwadi Era structures, has a centre section with a Bengali roof surrounded by two towers and two smaller entrances topped with domes. The structure is made of the same stone as the castle and is embellished with etchings of animals and ornate patterns.\n\n\n\nA model railway and a zoo: The mansion formerly had its own miniature railway and zoo. To transport his children from the school to the main Lakshmi Vilas Palace, the King built a small train line that encircled the mango grove within the palace grounds.\n\n\n\nThe surroundings of the Palace\n\n\n\nThe Fatehsinhrao Museum: The Fatehsinhrao Museum was built as a schoolhouse for the king&#8217;s children. The museum now houses a vast collection of works of art belonging to the royal family. The most notable of these is the magnificent collection of Raja Ravi Varma&#8217;s paintings, which were particularly acquired by the Maharaja of Baroda.\n\n\n\nThe museum is well-known among the locals for hosting the yearly Fort Building Competition and the Ganpati Idol Making Competition, both of which are open to both adults and children.\n\n\n\nThe Cricket Association and the Motibaug Palace: The Motibaug Palace is really a modest structure that precedes the mansion itself. It was originally built during Maharaja Ganpatrao Gaekwad&#8217;s era to accommodate the State&#8217;s architects and engineers. The Gaekwad Baroda Golf Club&#8217;s main club is now housed there. The Moti Bagh Cricket Ground, the administration of the Baroda Cricket Association, and a very unusual indoor teak coated tennis and badminton court are next to the Motibaug Palace and the Museum.\n\n\n\nThe Golf Club: Maharaja Pratapsinhrao built a golf course for his European visitors in the 1930s. The course was rebuilt and offered to the general populace in the 1990s by Pratapsinhrao&#8217;s grandson Samarjitsinh, a renowned Ranji Trophy cricket player. The Gaekwad Baroda Golf Club upgraded the course in 2004 into a magnificent course that presently has over 900 members.\n\n\n\nThe LVP Banquets: The LVP Banquets was established a few years ago with a tiny facility comprising of a few large and small halls. The sunken gardens, which are a part of the mansion, are also available for hire by the Banquets for arranging parties and ceremonies.\n\n\n\nA massive tree and an ecology: Over time, the gardens around the palace have acquired their own environment. Around the royal compound, langoors and peacocks may be seen in packs. Aside from that, the complex is home to a massive Banyan tree known as the &#8220;Sayaji Vad,&#8221; which is over a century old and has its own ecology.\n\n\n\nFacts about Lakshmi Vilas Palace\n\n\n\nDid you know that it is known to be the world&#8217;s largest private residence?\n\n\n\nThe interiors are reminiscent of a large European country house.\n\n\n\nIt had elevators when it was built, which was unusual.\n\n\n\nPrem Rog released in 1982, Dil Hi Toh Hai released in 1993, Sardaar Gabbar Singh released in 2016, and Grand Masti released in 2013, are just a few of the Bollywood films shot in this palace.\n\n\n\nValuation of Vadodara&#8217;s Lakshmi Vilas Palace\n\n\n\nMaharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III constructed Lakshmi Vilas Palace in 1890 for a staggering \u20b927,00,000 (\u00a31,80,000), which was a considerable sum at that time. The Moti Bagh Cricket Ground, as well as the administration of the well-known Baroda Cricket Association are located near the museum. Navlakhi Vav, a famous stepwell dating from 1405 AD, is also included inside the complex. While it is nearly hard to correctly describe the value of such a massive and intimidating national landmark, estimations suggest that property values in this location might range from \u20b97,000 to \u20b98,000 per Sq. Ft. Taking all into consideration, it is worth noting that the palace compound covers 700 acres or 3,04,92,000 Sq. Ft. Using the current market cost of \u20b98,000 per Sq. Ft as a guide, the ultimate worth would be at least \u20b92,43,93,60,00,000. To put it another way, the Lakshmi Vilas Palace would be valued at a staggering twenty-four thousand three hundred and sixty crores and sixty lakhs. Given the structure&#8217;s cultural significance and history, this figure may potentially reach \u20b925,000 crores.\n\n\n\nEnding Remarks\n\n\n\nOverall, the palace is the pinnacle of grandeur and a testament of a king who used to be the world&#8217;s eighth richest man. The palace is one of the greatest examples of Indo-Saracenic architecture, which combines Hindu, Mughal, Rajasthani, and Western design. It is adorned with items by some of the world&#8217;s finest artisans. Last but not least, it is a depiction of the splendour of an Indian princely state. Picture the magnificence of India, which at one time had about 800 similar Princely States.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s Dig Deep Into The Grandeur of Vadodara\u2019s Lakshmi Vilas PalacePataudi Palace \u2013 Taimur\u2019s \u20b9800 Cr Royal InheritanceThe worth of Mysore Palace might surprise you!Make your  Small Abode a Happy Place to Live inLiving room decor ideas for cricket lovers\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ&#8217;s)\n\n\n        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhat is the location of Lakshmi Vilas Palace?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tJN Marg, Moti Baug, Vadodara is where Lakshmi Vilas Palace can be found.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWho is the palace&#8217;s principal architect?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe palace&#8217;s principal architect is claimed to be Major Charles Mant.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhat is the size of the Lakshmi Vilas Palace&#8217;s entire area?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Lakshmi Vilas Palace is spread across over 700 acres.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tIs it true that Lakshmi Vilas Palace is larger than Buckingham Palace?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe palace of Laxmi Vilas is four times the size of Buckingham Palace.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhat is the name of the person who owns Lakshmi Vilas Palace?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt is now headed by HRH Samarjitsinh Gaekwad, who is married to Radhikaraje Gaekwad and has two daughters with her.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t\nThe post Let\u2019s Dig Deep Into The Grandeur of Vadodara\u2019s Lakshmi Vilas Palace appeared first on Real Estate News.",

Its initial crowning achievement was the establishment of Crossroads, Mumbai&#8217;s first retail mall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Altamount Road in Tardeo is a major thoroughfare in south Mumbai that links key business sectors in the area. It is also home to Antilla, which is India&#8217;s most valuable private property, Tardeo contains a variety of commercial buildings, including educational and healthcare facilities. Because there are limited residential possibilities in the region, it is one of Mumbai&#8217;s most pricey locations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The average price of a residence in Tardeo is \u20b947,786 per square foot.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-juhu-beverly-hills-of-bollywood\"><strong>Juhu: Beverly Hills of Bollywood</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">When a residential area is affectionately dubbed as the &#8220;Beverly Hills of Bollywood,&#8221; you know it&#8217;s upscale.

Siraj Lokhandwala bought the region in 1968 when it was still just a large swamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Many realtors attempted to talk him out of it at the time, claiming that people wouldn&#8217;t want to live so far from the city core.

It does rounds on the Internet when a business tycoon or Bollywood celebrity buys an apartment or building for a very high sum. Mumbai is consistently ranked one of the most expensive places to buy property.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Price is defined by the relationship of demand and supply, as most of us are aware. The greater the cost, the lesser the supply. Likewise, when demand increases, so does the cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-so-what-are-the-causes-that-are-reducing-property-supply-and-raising-demand-in-mumbai\"><strong>So, what are the causes that are reducing property supply and raising demand in Mumbai?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Government Policy:</strong> Another aspect is government policy. Circle rates, set by the government, determine not just the minimum stamp duty but also the starting price. Mumbai&#8217;s prices have gone up by upto 20% in past years, which is significantly higher than the rest of the nation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Rent Control:</strong> Rent regulation has an impact on real estate supply since a significant proportion of renters, particularly in the city&#8217;s best locations, may live on monthly rates of less than 500 rupees. Because landowners are not allowed to raise this rent due to government price controls, the burden on non-rent-controlled properties to generate taxes is considerably greater.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Inward Migration:</strong> For years, Mumbai has undoubtedly been India&#8217;s business hub.

            "content_text": "Mumbai has been branded as the city of dreams, India&#8217;s financial hub and entertainment capital, and the city that never sleeps. Luxurious apartments, posh localities, fine-dining establishments, state-of-the-art development, swanky entertainment zones, and glamorous retail malls surround the bustling metropolis city.\n\n\n\nMumbai, which is bordered by the Arabian Sea, is home to a slew of business tycoons, entrepreneurs, celebrities, cricketers, politicians, and other notable public figures. So, it&#8217;s only reasonable that the city of dreams has a plethora of opulent neighbourhoods. While low-income housing remains a challenge for many Mumbai citizens, the city also has a diverse range of affluent neighbourhoods.\n\n\n\nThese areas are frequently distinguished by the presence of lavish amenities such as closeness to the sea, cutting-edge infrastructure, and so on. Do you intend to move to a new suburban Mumbai residential area? Or are you a first-time visitor to Mumbai who wants to see the magic and aura of the city?\n\n\n\nIn any event, visiting Mumbai&#8217;s most lush localities is highly advised. Take a glance at our top recommendations of the top expensive areas of Mumbai.\n\n\n\nMalabar Hill: Most Expensive Area in Mumbai\n\n\n\nMalabar Hill is one of Mumbai&#8217;s most upscale areas, located atop a hilltop in South Mumbai. The Girgaon Chowpatty Beach, Back Bay, and Nariman Point are all within walking distance of most residences in this region, which provide unobstructed views of the Mumbai skyline.\n\n\n\nThis is one of the primary causes behind Malabar Hill&#8217;s exorbitant real estate costs. It is well recognized for housing several notable government officials&#8217; private homes.\n\n\n\nRaj Bhavan, Maharashtra&#8217;s Governor&#8217;s official estate, and Varsha Bungalow-Maharashtra&#8217;s Chief Minister&#8217;s house, all are located on Malabar Hill.\n\n\n\nPallonji Mistry, the Petit family, the Jindal family, Adi Godrej, and Shashi Ruia are among the numerous corporate moguls that call this posh locality their home. The Hanging Gardens, Jain Temple, and Banganga Tank are among Malabar Hill&#8217;s other renowned landmarks.\n\n\n\nThe average price of a residence in Malabar Hill is \u20b951,500 per square foot.\n\n\n\nWorli: The Heart of Mumbai\n\n\n\nWorli is among the seven islands that make up modern-day Mumbai. It was once a fishing town. It has been turned into an urban residential hotspot owing to its strategic position and world-class facilities.\n\n\n\nIt also links the Bandra Kurla Complex and Nariman Point, two of Mumbai&#8217;s most prominent business districts. As a result, Worli has become one of Mumbai&#8217;s most premium suburbs.\n\n\n\nThe magnificent Bandra-Worli Sea Link, which opened in 2009, has added to Worli&#8217;s skyrocketing land values.\n\n\n\nWorli is now considerably more accessible thanks to the bridge that links it to Bandra, Mumbai&#8217;s western district. Worli is home to a number of famous entrepreneurs, including Narayan Murthy, Anil Agarwal, Nandan Nilekani, Anand Piramal, and Isha Ambani.\n\n\n\nRetail stores, eateries, nightclubs, and other commercial enterprises dominate the neighbourhood, making it one of the most popular recreational spots for working professionals on the island metropolis.\n\n\n\nThe average price of a residence in Worli is \u20b937,013 per square foot.\n\n\n\nTardeo: Top Expensive Areas in Mumbai\n\n\n\nTardeo is an upscale area in South Mumbai that stretches from Nana Chowk to Haji Ali Junction. Its initial crowning achievement was the establishment of Crossroads, Mumbai&#8217;s first retail mall.\n\n\n\nAltamount Road in Tardeo is a major thoroughfare in south Mumbai that links key business sectors in the area. It is also home to Antilla, which is India&#8217;s most valuable private property, Tardeo contains a variety of commercial buildings, including educational and healthcare facilities. Because there are limited residential possibilities in the region, it is one of Mumbai&#8217;s most pricey locations.\n\n\n\nThe average price of a residence in Tardeo is \u20b947,786 per square foot.\n\n\n\nJuhu: Beverly Hills of Bollywood\n\n\n\nWhen a residential area is affectionately dubbed as the &#8220;Beverly Hills of Bollywood,&#8221; you know it&#8217;s upscale. Juhu, which is bordered on the west by the Arabian Sea, is host to Bollywood&#8217;s most well-known stars.\n\n\n\nThe bungalows of renowned cinema actors like Amitabh Bachchan, Hema Malini, Akshay Kumar, Shahid Kapoor, and others may be found here. Jalsa, Amitabh Bachchan&#8217;s home, continues to attract a crowd of cinema fans from all across the country.\n\n\n\nAs a result, Juhu is one of Mumbai&#8217;s most expensive neighbourhoods. There are also a number of prominent educational institutes as well as vibrant caf\u00e9s.\n\n\n\nApart from being home to a slew of Bollywood royalty, Juhu is famous for its beautiful beach. JW Marriott, Prithvi Theatre, The Orchid Hotel, and ISKCON Temple are among the other main landmarks. The Juhu Chowpatty, where street food sellers set up their shops in the evening, is also well-known in the neighbourhood.\n\n\n\nJuhu is therefore both an affluent suburb and a popular tourist destination in Mumbai.\n\n\n\nThe average price of a residence in Juhu is \u20b944,442 per square foot.\n\n\n\nBandra: Posh Localities of Mumbai\n\n\n\nBandra is Maharashtra&#8217;s third-largest business center, located on the western outskirts of the city. Bandra&#8217;s most well-known landmarks include Pali Hill, Bandra Kurla Complex and Carter Road.\n\n\n\nBandra, popularly referred to as the Queen of Suburbs, is home to a plethora of fancy diners, bars, and caf\u00e9s. Hill Road and Linking Road in Bandra are also home to Mumbai&#8217;s iconic clothing stores.\n\n\n\nBandra, similar to other affluent localities in Mumbai is home to a slew of Bollywood stars, sportsmen, and politicians. Mannat, Shah Rukh Khan&#8217;s Lands End house, is one of Bandra&#8217;s most renowned tourist destinations. Galaxy Towers, Salman Khan&#8217;s mansion, is also only around a mile away.\n\n\n\nThe average price of a residence in Bandra is \u20b942,691 per square foot.\n\n\n\nLokhandwala Complex Now Comes In Posh Areas of Mumbai\n\n\n\nLokhandwala Complex is an upscale Mumbai neighbourhood located near Andheri West. Siraj Lokhandwala bought the region in 1968 when it was still just a large swamp.\n\n\n\nMany realtors attempted to talk him out of it at the time, claiming that people wouldn&#8217;t want to live so far from the city core. Lokhandwala Complex now has become one of Mumbai&#8217;s most coveted suburbs.\n\n\n\nLokhandwala Complex, which is home to numerous movie stars, directors, and singers, is full of luxurious retail malls, gourmet restaurants, and trendy caf\u00e9s.\n\n\n\nThere are also a number of well-kept parks and walking tracks. The average price of a residence in Lokhandwala Complex is \u20b932,230 per square foot.\n\n\n\nLower Parel: Offers Cosmopolitan High-rise Living\n\n\n\nLower Parel was once home to a large number of factories. The region has been turned into an important business centre as a result of increasing urban development and the shutdown of the factories.\n\n\n\nIt now has a plethora of major media companies, marketing companies, and commercial institutions. As a result, it has become one of Mumbai&#8217;s top luxurious locations.\n\n\n\nLower Parel is home to several business tycoons, entrepreneurs, and other senior-level professionals. There are several restaurants, caf\u00e9s, and bars in the neighbourhood.\n\n\n\nKamala Mills is among Lower Parel&#8217;s most vibrant areas. Lower Parel is the ideal location for those seeking a cosmopolitan area with high-rises, companies, and bustling nightlife.\n\n\n\nThe average price of a residence in Lower Parel is \u20b929,800 per square foot.\n\n\n\nPowai: Experience Living in Luxurious Villas and Condos\n\n\n\nHiranandani Gardens, in Powai, is an affluent township with 42 residential structures and 23 business towers. Luxurious villas, condos, cottages, and commercial buildings may be found here.\n\n\n\nWhat used to be a desolate, inhospitable region has been converted into one of Mumbai&#8217;s most well-kept and affluent neighbourhoods. It is also Mumbai&#8217;s entrepreneurial center.\n\n\n\nHiranandani, as it is known, is a self-contained area with educational institutions, gardens, retail malls, clubhouses, swimming pools, and healthcare facilities. Hiranandani is also home to a number of wealth management and corporate finance businesses, in addition to startup companies.\n\n\n\nThe average price of a residence in Powai is \u20b929,097 per square foot.\n\n\n\nColaba: Home to Richest Society in Mumbai\n\n\n\nColaba is the place in Mumbai where the past and the present collide with each other. Apart from being one of Mumbai&#8217;s most pricey localities, it is also the epicenter of the city&#8217;s heritage and literature.\n\n\n\nThere are several art galleries, theaters, museums, and impeccable examples of colonial architecture to be found here. In addition, classic caf\u00e9s such as Leopold Cafe and Cafe Mondegar can be found in Colaba.\n\n\n\nRatan Tata, the entrepreneur, and Ravi Shastri, the cricketer, are both inhabitants of Colaba. The Gateway of India, the Taj Mahal Palace, and the Colaba Causeway are just a few of Colaba&#8217;s most renowned tourist sites.\n\n\n\nColaba is the place to go if you&#8217;re searching for a wealthy Mumbai neighbourhood with a sense of history and sentimentality.\n\n\n\nThe average price of a residence in Colaba is \u20b937,354 per square foot.\n\n\n\nVersova: Opulent Mumbai Suburb\n\n\n\nVersova, approximately 10 kilometers from Bandra, is another opulent Mumbai suburb. It is well known for its long stretches of coastline and the stunning Versova Fort.\n\n\n\nVersova, which was formerly the land&nbsp;of the Kolis (Mumbai&#8217;s fisherman population), has seen significant growth in recent years.\n\n\n\nIt is home to Bollywood celebrities like Priyanka Chopra, Manisha Koirala, Randeep Hooda, Arshad Warsi, and others. Many great eateries and bars may also be found in the neighbourhood.\n\n\n\nThe average price of a residence in Versova is \u20b922,738 per sq. ft.\n\n\n\nRecent Big-Ticket Home Deals in Mumbai That Made Headlines:\n\n\n\nAjay Devgn buys a palatial bungalow in Juhu worth \u20b960 Crore.\n\n\n\nArjun Kapoor buys a sea-facing extravagant 4 BHK apartment worth \u20b920 crores.\n\n\n\nSunny Leone buys a luxurious duplex apartment in Andheri for \u20b916 core.\n\n\n\nBillionaire investor and founder of D-Mart, Radhakishan Damani buys a luxe bungalow in south Mumbai\u2019s Malabar Hill locale for worth&nbsp; \u20b91,001 crores.\n\n\n\nWhy Such Skyrocket Prices in Mumbai?\n\n\n\nAlmost every week, there is news of a big-ticket real estate investment in Mumbai. It does rounds on the Internet when a business tycoon or Bollywood celebrity buys an apartment or building for a very high sum. Mumbai is consistently ranked one of the most expensive places to buy property.\n\n\n\nPrice is defined by the relationship of demand and supply, as most of us are aware. The greater the cost, the lesser the supply. Likewise, when demand increases, so does the cost.\n\n\n\nSo, what are the causes that are reducing property supply and raising demand in Mumbai?\n\n\n\nGovernment Policy: Another aspect is government policy. Circle rates, set by the government, determine not just the minimum stamp duty but also the starting price. Mumbai&#8217;s prices have gone up by upto 20% in past years, which is significantly higher than the rest of the nation.\n\n\n\nRent Control: Rent regulation has an impact on real estate supply since a significant proportion of renters, particularly in the city&#8217;s best locations, may live on monthly rates of less than 500 rupees. Because landowners are not allowed to raise this rent due to government price controls, the burden on non-rent-controlled properties to generate taxes is considerably greater.\n\n\n\nInward Migration: For years, Mumbai has undoubtedly been India&#8217;s business hub. Mumbai has opportunities for everyone, from white-collar occupations to basic labour sustaining the wealthy&#8217;s lives. However, this inflow of migrants puts strain on the city to provide housing. Investment Buyers: A type of purchaser branded as &#8220;investment buyers&#8221; \u2013 individuals who have no intention of living in Mumbai but want to purchase real estate there in the hopes of profiting later \u2013 is also creating too much demand. These purchasers, who are mostly non-resident Indians or individuals with significant sums of unregulated money, add to the already massive demand.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\nPosh Areas in Mumbai: Coveted Destinations in Maximum CityTop Localities to Invest in Mumbai Real EstateWorli becomes luxury housing destination in MumbaiBranded residences become a trend in Dubai realty marketA Complete Guide to Mumbai&#8217;s Queen of the Suburbs: Bandra West\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ&#8217;s)\n\n\n        \n            \n\t\t\t\tIs Andheri an affluent neighbourhood?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAndheri is a semi-affluent neighbourhood where housing costs are rising due to great demand, yet housing options are limited.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tIs Juhu an affluent neighbourhood?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tYes, Juhu is one of Mumbai&#8217;s affluent neighbourhoods.

            "content_html": "\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Understanding the technical jargon used by real estate brokers is critical for potential homebuyers to prevent mistakes that might jeopardize their chances of acquiring the house of their dreams. In India, developers and agents frequently use the words carpet area, built-up area, and super built-up area, prompting many people to search for explanations on the internet. In reality, some fraudulent companies have taken advantage of customers&#8217; lack of information by demanding greater costs. As a result, it is critical that you complete your study before speaking with your agent again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Square Yards explains the distinctions between the carpet area, built-up area, and super built-up area, three widely used terminologies:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-carpet-area\">Carpet Area</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">A carpet area is an area that may be covered by a carpet, as the name suggests. The actual usable floor space of a house is determined by the distance between walls. Builders are required by RERA (Real Estate Regulation and Development Act) rules to reveal the carpet area of each unit upon which the selling price must be determined. This space does not include the area occupied by the exterior walls, balcony, or terrace, unlike the built-up area described below. The carpet area, which becomes your personal space, however, comprises the thickness of the house&#8217;s interior walls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The carpet area covers roughly 70% of the built-up area, which includes the living area, bedrooms, and other rooms, the kitchen and baths, and, on some occasions, even the interior stairway. Assuming you have a built-up space of 1,000 square feet, the carpet area will be 70% of 1,000 square feet or 700 square feet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-calculate-the-carpet-area-using-this-formula\">Calculate the carpet area using this formula</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Carpet area = bedroom + living area + balconies + toilets \u2013 inner wall thickness</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-can-you-make-sure-you-do-not-get-misled-when-it-comes-to-the-carpet-area\">How can you make sure you do not get misled when it comes to the carpet area?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">If you are purchasing a project in a large housing society, the developer is required by the RERA to disclose the carpet area of the unit. However, you need to hire a technical expert to come to the apartment and measure the space. If you apply for a mortgage, the bank will send a technical expert to inspect the property. Check with them to see whether the carpet area that the developer told you about is the same as what they estimated. If there are any inconsistencies, you should notify the developer and renegotiate the price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Another important point to keep in mind when buying a home is not to be carried away by the built-up or super-built-up area figures if the carpet area is not as per your preference. At the end of the day, the carpet area is the area that you will use in your everyday life. Ascertain that the three figures are perfectly balanced, with the carpet area taking the lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-a-few-other-things-to-keep-in-mind\">A few other things to keep in mind</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">While developers are now legally required to disclose the carpet area when measuring and pricing flats, provisions have been created for the measurement to be increased or decreased while a project is under construction. If the carpet area is lowered during construction, the developer is required to repay the extra cost to the customer within 45 days, plus yearly interest. If the carpet area is increased, the developer may require the buyer to pay the difference. The RERA, on the other hand, stipulates that the increase in carpet area cannot exceed 3%.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-built-up-area\">Built-up Area</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The built-up area is the total size of the residential unit, which includes the carpet area as well as the thickness of the walls. This includes the area covered by the balcony or terrace. It usually accounts for roughly 70 to 80 percent of the estate&#8217;s super built-up area. It should be remembered that the proportion may differ depending on the project or builder. The built-up area, on the other hand, is created by adding 10 to 15% more room to the carpet area. Assuming a super built-up area of 1,200 square feet, the built-up area will be 70% or 80% of 1,200 square feet, or 840 square feet or 960 square feet, respectively, while the carpet area will be 588 square feet or 672 square feet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-calculate-the-built-up-area-using-this-formula\">Calculate the built-up area using this formula</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Built-up area = carpet area + wall area + balcony area</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-carpet-area-vs-built-up-area-what-is-the-difference\">Carpet Area vs Built-up Area: What is the difference?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Carpet area refers to the space that may be covered by a carpet, whereas built-up area refers to the area that remains after the carpet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-super-built-up-area\">Super Built-up Area</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The super built-up area is the total of the built-up area plus the space used by common spaces such as the lobby, stairwell, lift, shafts, and clubhouse, among other things. Developers frequently charge consumers depending on this area to recoup their building costs. As a result, it is known as the &#8220;saleable&#8221; area. The loading factor, which is the proportionate share of the common space in a flat derived by multiplying the carpet area by a multiplier (1.25), is closely linked to the super built-up area. This equates to a 25% or 30% increase in total saleable area. The difference between the super built-up area and the carpet area is used to calculate its value. The loading factor is used by many builders to determine the pricing of a unit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Developers frequently utilized the super-built-up area as the space-measuring unit before the RERA made it necessary for them to sell apartments based on carpet area, to take advantage of the lack of clarity on space computation. They were able to reduce the properties per Sq. Ft cost by using a super built-up area as the measurement unit. It also gave the customer the idea that they were purchasing a huge home when they weren&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Since it becomes a benchmark for builders to charge their customers, the super built-up area is also known as the saleable area,\u201d says Vijay Verma, CEO, Sunworld Group. The computation of a super built-up area is done differently when there is more than one unit on a level, he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Assume a residence with a carpet area of 1,000 square feet that costs \u20b92,000 per square foot. The total cost of the property, in this case, will be \u20b920,00,000. A builder will give the super built-up area (let&#8217;s say, 1,300 sq. ft) and price the home cheaper at, say, \u20b91,800 per Sq. Ft to make the marketing pitch even more appealing. In this case, the property&#8217;s total price will be \u20b923.40 lakhs. The latter would sound far more appealing to an uninformed consumer than the former.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-calculate-the-super-built-up-area-using-this-formula\">Calculate the super built-up area using this formula</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Built-up area + proportional common area = super built-up area.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Or</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Carpet&nbsp;area (1+loading factor) = Super built-up area</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Remember:</strong> Based on the developer and the specific location, the loading might be anywhere from 15 to 50 percent.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-example-of-calculating-the-super-built-up-area\"><strong>Example of calculating the super built-up area</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The super built-up area is computed differently when there are many units on a floor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Suppose Rahul Patel owns a flat with a built-up area of 1,000 Sq. Ft on the fifth level of a housing society. Arun Prasad has a flat on the same level with a built-up area of 2,000 square feet. The floor&#8217;s entire common area is 1,500 square feet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">To calculate the super built-up area of the two flats the developer would split the built-up areas of the two flats by their ratio (in this example 1:2), then add 500 square feet to Patel&#8217;s total built-up area and 1,000 square feet to Prasad&#8217;s built-up area. Patel&#8217;s flat now has a super built-up size of 1,500 Sq. Ft, whereas Prasad&#8217;s has a super built-up area of 3,000 square feet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-can-purchasers-refuse-to-pay-for-a-developer-s-increase-in-carpet-area\"><strong>Can purchasers refuse to pay for a developer&#8217;s increase in carpet area?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Due to revisions in the plan and an increase in the carpet area, the developer has increased the overall price of the house on several occasions. The purchaser is responsible for the additional charges under RERA&#8217;s terms. In a case brought by Ashley Neil Serrao and Mark Clement Serrao, who had acquired a property in Runwal Greens by Propel Developers Pvt Ltd, the Maharashtra RERA has openly stated that the purchaser is responsible for paying the extra money.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-to-determine-the-area-of-your-future-home-s-usable-space\"><strong>How to determine the area of your future home&#8217;s usable space?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Always inquire about the carpet area of the apartment and base your price negotiations on this figure. You could seek the assistance of a private technical assessor to re-confirm the carpet area in the apartment so that there is no room for any deception. Those who purchase a home with the aid of housing financing are in a stronger position since the bank will send its own legal and technical assessors to inspect the property&#8217;s specifications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Another thing to keep in mind is that even if a developer quotes the price of a home-based on carpet area, they will almost always increase per Sq. Ft cost to account for the built-up and super built-up areas. Try to find out how much similar projects in the region cost to see whether the amount your builder offered is reasonable. If not, the buyer has the option of negotiating the agreement and attempting to lower the pricing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-few-more-terms\"><strong>Few More Terms</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-noc-no-objection-certificate\"><strong>NOC (No Objection Certificate)</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">A no objection certificate is a legal document that states that an individual or corporation has been granted authorization to purchase or build real estate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-occupancy-certificate-oc\"><strong>Occupancy certificate (OC)</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The occupancy certificate is a crucial document that verifies that the building was built according to the approved designs and in accordance with local regulations. After verifying that all local laws have been followed, the local municipal corporation releases this document. The occupancy certificate must be obtained by the developer. When offering loans to property buyers, many financial firms require an occupancy certificate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-completion-certificate-cc\"><strong>Completion certificate (CC)</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">A completion certification is a legal document that certifies that a new building has been erected and completed in accordance with the Buildings Act&#8217;s safety standards and regulations, as well as municipal legislation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-haryana-rera-has-issued-laws-requiring-flats-to-be-sold-only-based-on-carpet-area\"><strong>Haryana (RERA) has issued laws requiring flats to be sold only based on carpet area</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">On April 27, 2021, the Haryana Real Estate Regulatory Authority (HARERA) announced that developers can only offer flats in their developments based on carpet area. The state RERA declared that the selling of apartments on a super area or any other bench would be considered deceptive and an unfair commercial activity, and that developers who violated these instructions would face penalties. \u201cIn real estate developments, the property is not correctly represented by stating the super area without precisely describing and breaking down the components contained in the super area. \u201cThe practice of selling real estate on a super area basis is deceptive, imprecise, opaque, and leads to misunderstanding and difficulties, as well as unnecessary litigation,\u201d stated KK Khandelwal, chairman of Haryana RERA.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-you-might-also-like\">You Might Also Like</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-yoast-seo-related-links\"><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/some-of-the-key-terms-used-in-real-estate\">Some of the key terms used in Real Estate</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/rera-carpet-area\">RERA Carpet Area: Things You Must Know About</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/carpet-area-vs-built-up-area-vs-super-area\">Carpet area vs. built up area vs. super area</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/how-carpet-area-definition-changes-in-rera\">How carpet area definition changes in RERA</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/build-up-super-build-up\">Built up &amp;

The loading factor is used by many builders to determine the pricing of a unit.\n\n\n\nDevelopers frequently utilized the super-built-up area as the space-measuring unit before the RERA made it necessary for them to sell apartments based on carpet area, to take advantage of the lack of clarity on space computation. They were able to reduce the properties per Sq. Ft cost by using a super built-up area as the measurement unit. It also gave the customer the idea that they were purchasing a huge home when they weren&#8217;t.\n\n\n\nSince it becomes a benchmark for builders to charge their customers, the super built-up area is also known as the saleable area,\u201d says Vijay Verma, CEO, Sunworld Group. The computation of a super built-up area is done differently when there is more than one unit on a level, he says.\n\n\n\nAssume a residence with a carpet area of 1,000 square feet that costs \u20b92,000 per square foot. The total cost of the property, in this case, will be \u20b920,00,000. A builder will give the super built-up area (let&#8217;s say, 1,300 sq. ft) and price the home cheaper at, say, \u20b91,800 per Sq. Ft to make the marketing pitch even more appealing. In this case, the property&#8217;s total price will be \u20b923.40 lakhs. The latter would sound far more appealing to an uninformed consumer than the former.\n\n\n\nCalculate the super built-up area using this formula\n\n\n\nBuilt-up area + proportional common area = super built-up area.\n\n\n\nOr\n\n\n\nCarpet&nbsp;area (1+loading factor) = Super built-up area\n\n\n\nRemember: Based on the developer and the specific location, the loading might be anywhere from 15 to 50 percent.\n\n\n\nExample of calculating the super built-up area\n\n\n\nThe super built-up area is computed differently when there are many units on a floor.\n\n\n\nSuppose Rahul Patel owns a flat with a built-up area of 1,000 Sq. Ft on the fifth level of a housing society. Arun Prasad has a flat on the same level with a built-up area of 2,000 square feet. The floor&#8217;s entire common area is 1,500 square feet.\n\n\n\nTo calculate the super built-up area of the two flats the developer would split the built-up areas of the two flats by their ratio (in this example 1:2), then add 500 square feet to Patel&#8217;s total built-up area and 1,000 square feet to Prasad&#8217;s built-up area. Patel&#8217;s flat now has a super built-up size of 1,500 Sq. Ft, whereas Prasad&#8217;s has a super built-up area of 3,000 square feet.\n\n\n\nCan purchasers refuse to pay for a developer&#8217;s increase in carpet area?\n\n\n\nDue to revisions in the plan and an increase in the carpet area, the developer has increased the overall price of the house on several occasions. The purchaser is responsible for the additional charges under RERA&#8217;s terms. In a case brought by Ashley Neil Serrao and Mark Clement Serrao, who had acquired a property in Runwal Greens by Propel Developers Pvt Ltd, the Maharashtra RERA has openly stated that the purchaser is responsible for paying the extra money.\n\n\n\nHow to determine the area of your future home&#8217;s usable space?\n\n\n\nAlways inquire about the carpet area of the apartment and base your price negotiations on this figure. You could seek the assistance of a private technical assessor to re-confirm the carpet area in the apartment so that there is no room for any deception. Those who purchase a home with the aid of housing financing are in a stronger position since the bank will send its own legal and technical assessors to inspect the property&#8217;s specifications.\n\n\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that even if a developer quotes the price of a home-based on carpet area, they will almost always increase per Sq. Ft cost to account for the built-up and super built-up areas. Try to find out how much similar projects in the region cost to see whether the amount your builder offered is reasonable. If not, the buyer has the option of negotiating the agreement and attempting to lower the pricing.\n\n\n\nFew More Terms\n\n\n\nNOC (No Objection Certificate)\n\n\n\nA no objection certificate is a legal document that states that an individual or corporation has been granted authorization to purchase or build real estate.\n\n\n\nOccupancy certificate (OC)\n\n\n\nThe occupancy certificate is a crucial document that verifies that the building was built according to the approved designs and in accordance with local regulations. After verifying that all local laws have been followed, the local municipal corporation releases this document. The occupancy certificate must be obtained by the developer. When offering loans to property buyers, many financial firms require an occupancy certificate.\n\n\n\nCompletion certificate (CC)\n\n\n\nA completion certification is a legal document that certifies that a new building has been erected and completed in accordance with the Buildings Act&#8217;s safety standards and regulations, as well as municipal legislation.\n\n\n\nHaryana (RERA) has issued laws requiring flats to be sold only based on carpet area\n\n\n\nOn April 27, 2021, the Haryana Real Estate Regulatory Authority (HARERA) announced that developers can only offer flats in their developments based on carpet area. The state RERA declared that the selling of apartments on a super area or any other bench would be considered deceptive and an unfair commercial activity, and that developers who violated these instructions would face penalties. \u201cIn real estate developments, the property is not correctly represented by stating the super area without precisely describing and breaking down the components contained in the super area. \u201cThe practice of selling real estate on a super area basis is deceptive, imprecise, opaque, and leads to misunderstanding and difficulties, as well as unnecessary litigation,\u201d stated KK Khandelwal, chairman of Haryana RERA.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\nSome of the key terms used in Real EstateRERA Carpet Area: Things You Must Know AboutCarpet area vs. built up area vs. super areaHow carpet area definition changes in RERABuilt up &amp; Super built up area\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n\n        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhat is the definition of carpet area?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe carpet area is the area of the house that may be occupied by a carpet, omitting the thickness of the interior walls.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhat is the formula for calculating carpet area?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you know the precise built-up area, you can determine the carpet area.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tAs per RERA, what is a carpet area?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs per the RERA, carpet area is defined as &#8220;a house&#8217;s net usable floor space.&#8221;                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhat is contained in the carpet area?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe space covered by exterior walls, spaces beneath services shafts, exclusive balcony or verandah area, and exclusive open terrace area are not included in the carpet area.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tHow can you figure out how much loading is on your carpet area?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf a developer uses a loading factor of 1.25, it implies that the carpet area of the flat has been increased by 2%.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t\nThe post Get Familiar With These Real-Estate Terms: Carpet Area, Built-Up Area and Super Built-Up Area appeared first on Real Estate News.",

            "content_html": "\n<h2 id=\"h-what-does-a-bhk-stand-for\"><strong>What does a BHK stand for?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">BHK is an abbreviation for bedroom, hall, and kitchen. It is used to communicate the number of bedrooms and other arrangements in a flat/property. BHK is utilized in the real estate division pretty frequently. It is simply a Bedroom, Hall, and Kitchen&#8217;s short-form like below:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>B = Bedroom<br>H = Hall<br>K = Kitchen</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Nowadays real estate market has classified/categorized all studios/flats as 1BHK, 2 BHK, 3 BHK, etc. like the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1BHK is 1 bedroom, hall, and kitchen<br>2BHK is 2 bedrooms, hall, and kitchen<br>3BHK is 3 bedrooms, hall, and kitchen<br>4BHK is 4 bedrooms, hall, and kitchen</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">When a person addresses a specific flat of an apartment as 1 BHK, the person is explaining that the flat/apartment has 1 Bedroom, 1 Hall, and 1 Kitchen respectively. Likewise, if a person labels a 2 BHK, the person is representing about 2 Bedrooms, 1 Hall, 1 Kitchen, and 3 Bedrooms, 1 Hall, 1 Kitchen each.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">A 3BHK arrangement indicates a flat pattern that has three bedrooms, one hall, and one kitchen in the apartment/flat.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-below-are-a-detailed-description-of-the-flat-or-tenement-arrangements\"><strong>Below are a detailed description of the flat or tenement arrangements</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>S.No.</strong></td><td><strong>Notation</strong></td><td><strong>Standard Size</strong></td><td><strong>BHK Full-Form Explanation</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1.</td><td>1 BHK</td><td>400 \u2013 500 sq.ft</td><td>1 Bedroom, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen Standard flat with 1 Bedroom, 1 Living Room and 1 Kitchen</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>2 BHK</td><td>850-1000 sq. ft&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>2 Bedroom, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen Typical flat with 2 Bedrooms, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen. 1 primary master Bedroom with a connected washroom and 1 Bedroom of the conventional size.</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>3 BHK</td><td>1200 \u2013 1500 sq. ft.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>3 Bedroom, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen Typical flat with 3 Bedrooms, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen. 2 Primary Master Bedrooms with connected washrooms and 1 Bedroom at regular size.</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>4 BHK</td><td>Above 2200 sq. ft&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>4 Bedroom, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen Typical flat with 3 Bedrooms, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen. 3 Primary Master Bedrooms with connected washrooms and 1 Bedroom at regular size.</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>2.5 BHK</td><td>Above 950 sq. ft&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>2.5 Bedroom, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen Standard flat with 2 regular measurement bedrooms, 0.5 signifies the bedroom size will be lesser than the standard size, so one can utilize it as a treasury or library as per our necessity.</td></tr><tr><td>6.</td><td>1 RK</td><td>400-500 sq. ft&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>1 Room &amp; 1 Kitchen Studio Apartments come under the category 1 room and 1 kitchen.

There are apartments on old-type constructions with the most extensive carpet area where 1RK is transformed into 1BHK by segregating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">As the full form implies, RK is Room and Kitchen. For instance, a 2 BHK, for the economy in property language, is associated with a 2 Bedroom Hall Kitchen. An RK has a room, washroom, and kitchen so it does not possess any complete wall divider to separate the house and it simply looks similar to a big room.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-is-a-penthouse\"><strong>What is a penthouse?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">A penthouse is a leisure apartment that is placed on the best, top-most floor of the arrangement. These flats have magnificent views of the horizon and the view gives a feeling of greatness to the inhabitants. The word \u2018penthouse\u2019 is basically referred to a smaller \u2018house\u2019 that was built on the rooftop of a building. Balconies and rooftop levels are the remarkable high point of penthouse flats/apartments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-is-a-studio-apartment\"><strong>What is a studio apartment?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">A studio apartment is a tiny apartment that connects several rooms, usually the hall, bedroom, and kitchen. These types of apartments regularly include one large room that usually works as the living, dining, and bedroom or may consist of a pretty small pad for a bedroom. The kitchen equipment may be placed in the middle room, or a tiny separate room, and the washroom is normally in a tiny space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The studio flat is an apartment with only one room. These apartments are also recognized as single-room residence rooms or studio apartments. They are also introduced as Efficiency Flats.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-difference-between-1bhk-and-1rk\"><strong>Difference between 1Bhk And 1RK</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The fundamental difference between 1Bhk And 1RK is that the hall is not present. One BHK is ideal for tiny and lower-middle-income families because it consists of a room, a hall, and an individual kitchen so the people will eventually turn the hall into a different room where the kids of the family can grow up. But in a 1RK, only a room and an individual kitchen are present with the absence of a hall that could be transformed into a different room for children, so it could be valid solely for the bachelors. BHK gives extra range while the RK is restricted and the price of BHK is more than RK but not too much, so it is recommended to have a BHK rather than having RK.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-bhk-usage\"><strong>BHK usage</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The full form of \u2018BHK\u2019 is utilized to apply to the arrangement and not simply flats but also in villas, independent tenements, builder floor homes, and cottages too. In the category of plots, the word \u2018BHK\u2019 is not relevant, except when someone is utilizing it to point to future arrangements. \u2013 for instance, \u2018You can construct a 3BHK residence on this land.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-is-the-0-5bhk-arrangement\"><strong>What is the 0.5BHK arrangement?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Constructors have been exploring different arrangements that are accepted by the home purchasers. For small households or individual professionals, this 0.5BHK might be adequate. It points to a flat arrangement that has a single bedroom that is somewhat tinier than a regular-sized bedroom, a washroom/bath, and a kitchen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-does-2-5bhk-mean\"><strong>What does 2.5BHK mean?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">A 2.5BHK arrangement consists of two rooms as well as a small room that can be utilized as a library or helper room. These kinds of arrangements are frequently converted to modern units, particularly in the regions like Delhi NCR. Medium-sized households, with four to five people, frequently choose these kinds of arrangements because it provides them the leisure of 3 BHK units at a comparatively cheaper price.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-to-comprehend-about-the-property-s-measurement\"><strong>What to comprehend about the property\u2019s measurement?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">If you estimate the lot dimensions of an estate you are fascinated with purchasing or marketing, you will surely understand specifically what you&#8217;re trading with. Understanding the lot dimension also permits you to know if later expansion is probable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The price of your estate depends on the actual size, or sq. footage, of your house and the land that it is placed on. You can discover the lot size of your real estate assets with manageable arithmetical calculations. Online tools that are free are great at obtaining your lot size falling to the sq. ft.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-lot-size-for-development\"><strong>Lot Size for Development</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">While you might be content with the lot measurement and your house, you might require to develop on the lot by joining either an outside shed or a stand-alone garage. The lot area of the estate also partially defines if you can develop the current buildings inside the property lines or attach new constructions on your land. Town codes and state laws are implemented, so constantly be informed of your regional codes and laws.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-to-obtain-the-property-lot-size\"><strong>How to Obtain the Property Lot Size</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">If you aren\u2019t certain regarding the lot size, yearly tax latest updates and additional state-generated data may give the lot measurement simultaneously with the other important information. The state records department in your town will own your primary lot size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">These are standard offices, so you can be assured that you know the accurate lot size to apply in any legal potential you may require.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-keeping-it-standard\"><strong>Keeping It Standard</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">If you want to determine lot dimensions for legitimate reasons or to market your assets, then you&#8217;ll be required to hold some necessary records in place. Be sure you possess the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Deed</li><li>Title report</li><li>Proper surveys that were hired by you or past buyers/sellers<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-to-understand-the-deed\"><strong>How to Understand the Deed</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The deed will include a summary of the resources and the measurement of all of the lot\u2019s edges. For a little fee, the state records department can print out a photocopy of the deed if you do not possess one on file. Or, you might be able to obtain it online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The property papers or preceding title report will constitute a scale plan that provides the capital and the enclosing lot borders. If the estate survey report was successfully finished, then it will additionally show the surrounding property lines, in more detail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The division assessor office\u2019s standard website may have an online photocopy of tax documents and lot sizes. This can save you money and time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-to-measure-the-lot-size\"><strong>How to Measure the Lot Size</strong><strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Once you have hunted down all the necessary papers, you should get down to the features and estimate the lot size. Plot out the edges of the estate on paper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Distribute the sketch that you have pulled into the most simplistic configurations that the original land lines provide. If you possess a square lot, distribute the drawings into a square. For an unevenly shaped lot like those observed in provincial or undeveloped commercial sectors, you can distribute the sketch of the property into an asymmetrical polygon into two triangles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Practice a roll-out mapping tool to estimate any unknown limits and write these figures down in the relevant area of the design. A roll-out mapping tool is official for mapping a land line. They are free online and can value around $5 to higher than $100.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">A roll-out mapping tool is a simplistic piece of tools that maximum landowners who have marked a property or other space on their homeland may be familiar with.

            "content_text": "What does a BHK stand for?\n\n\n\nBHK is an abbreviation for bedroom, hall, and kitchen. It is used to communicate the number of bedrooms and other arrangements in a flat/property. BHK is utilized in the real estate division pretty frequently. It is simply a Bedroom, Hall, and Kitchen&#8217;s short-form like below:\n\n\n\nB = BedroomH = HallK = Kitchen\n\n\n\nNowadays real estate market has classified/categorized all studios/flats as 1BHK, 2 BHK, 3 BHK, etc. like the following:\n\n\n\n1BHK is 1 bedroom, hall, and kitchen2BHK is 2 bedrooms, hall, and kitchen3BHK is 3 bedrooms, hall, and kitchen4BHK is 4 bedrooms, hall, and kitchen\n\n\n\nWhen a person addresses a specific flat of an apartment as 1 BHK, the person is explaining that the flat/apartment has 1 Bedroom, 1 Hall, and 1 Kitchen respectively. Likewise, if a person labels a 2 BHK, the person is representing about 2 Bedrooms, 1 Hall, 1 Kitchen, and 3 Bedrooms, 1 Hall, 1 Kitchen each.\n\n\n\nA 3BHK arrangement indicates a flat pattern that has three bedrooms, one hall, and one kitchen in the apartment/flat.\n\n\n\nBelow are a detailed description of the flat or tenement arrangements\n\n\n\nS.No.NotationStandard SizeBHK Full-Form Explanation1.1 BHK400 \u2013 500 sq.ft1 Bedroom, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen Standard flat with 1 Bedroom, 1 Living Room and 1 Kitchen2.2 BHK850-1000 sq. ft&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 Bedroom, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen Typical flat with 2 Bedrooms, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen. 1 primary master Bedroom with a connected washroom and 1 Bedroom of the conventional size.3.3 BHK1200 \u2013 1500 sq. ft.&nbsp;&nbsp;3 Bedroom, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen Typical flat with 3 Bedrooms, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen. 2 Primary Master Bedrooms with connected washrooms and 1 Bedroom at regular size.4.4 BHKAbove 2200 sq. ft&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 Bedroom, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen Typical flat with 3 Bedrooms, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen. 3 Primary Master Bedrooms with connected washrooms and 1 Bedroom at regular size.5.2.5 BHKAbove 950 sq. ft&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5 Bedroom, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen Standard flat with 2 regular measurement bedrooms, 0.5 signifies the bedroom size will be lesser than the standard size, so one can utilize it as a treasury or library as per our necessity.6.1 RK400-500 sq. ft&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 Room &amp; 1 Kitchen Studio Apartments come under the category 1 room and 1 kitchen.

Simultaneously with 3 Shared Washrooms.Detailed description of the flat or tenement arrangements\n\n\n\nWhat is 1RK?\n\n\n\n1RK indicates just one room that connects a bedroom, washroom, and kitchen. There are apartments on old-type constructions with the most extensive carpet area where 1RK is transformed into 1BHK by segregating.\n\n\n\nAs the full form implies, RK is Room and Kitchen. For instance, a 2 BHK, for the economy in property language, is associated with a 2 Bedroom Hall Kitchen. An RK has a room, washroom, and kitchen so it does not possess any complete wall divider to separate the house and it simply looks similar to a big room.\n\n\n\nWhat is a penthouse?\n\n\n\nA penthouse is a leisure apartment that is placed on the best, top-most floor of the arrangement. These flats have magnificent views of the horizon and the view gives a feeling of greatness to the inhabitants. The word \u2018penthouse\u2019 is basically referred to a smaller \u2018house\u2019 that was built on the rooftop of a building. Balconies and rooftop levels are the remarkable high point of penthouse flats/apartments.\n\n\n\nWhat is a studio apartment?\n\n\n\nA studio apartment is a tiny apartment that connects several rooms, usually the hall, bedroom, and kitchen. These types of apartments regularly include one large room that usually works as the living, dining, and bedroom or may consist of a pretty small pad for a bedroom. The kitchen equipment may be placed in the middle room, or a tiny separate room, and the washroom is normally in a tiny space.\n\n\n\nThe studio flat is an apartment with only one room. These apartments are also recognized as single-room residence rooms or studio apartments. They are also introduced as Efficiency Flats.\n\n\n\nDifference between 1Bhk And 1RK\n\n\n\nThe fundamental difference between 1Bhk And 1RK is that the hall is not present. One BHK is ideal for tiny and lower-middle-income families because it consists of a room, a hall, and an individual kitchen so the people will eventually turn the hall into a different room where the kids of the family can grow up. But in a 1RK, only a room and an individual kitchen are present with the absence of a hall that could be transformed into a different room for children, so it could be valid solely for the bachelors. BHK gives extra range while the RK is restricted and the price of BHK is more than RK but not too much, so it is recommended to have a BHK rather than having RK.\n\n\n\nBHK usage\n\n\n\nThe full form of \u2018BHK\u2019 is utilized to apply to the arrangement and not simply flats but also in villas, independent tenements, builder floor homes, and cottages too. In the category of plots, the word \u2018BHK\u2019 is not relevant, except when someone is utilizing it to point to future arrangements. \u2013 for instance, \u2018You can construct a 3BHK residence on this land.\n\n\n\nWhat is the 0.5BHK arrangement?\n\n\n\nConstructors have been exploring different arrangements that are accepted by the home purchasers. For small households or individual professionals, this 0.5BHK might be adequate. It points to a flat arrangement that has a single bedroom that is somewhat tinier than a regular-sized bedroom, a washroom/bath, and a kitchen.\n\n\n\nWhat does 2.5BHK mean?\n\n\n\nA 2.5BHK arrangement consists of two rooms as well as a small room that can be utilized as a library or helper room. These kinds of arrangements are frequently converted to modern units, particularly in the regions like Delhi NCR. Medium-sized households, with four to five people, frequently choose these kinds of arrangements because it provides them the leisure of 3 BHK units at a comparatively cheaper price.\n\n\n\nWhat to comprehend about the property\u2019s measurement?\n\n\n\nIf you estimate the lot dimensions of an estate you are fascinated with purchasing or marketing, you will surely understand specifically what you&#8217;re trading with. Understanding the lot dimension also permits you to know if later expansion is probable.\n\n\n\nThe price of your estate depends on the actual size, or sq. footage, of your house and the land that it is placed on. You can discover the lot size of your real estate assets with manageable arithmetical calculations. Online tools that are free are great at obtaining your lot size falling to the sq. ft.\n\n\n\nLot Size for Development\n\n\n\nWhile you might be content with the lot measurement and your house, you might require to develop on the lot by joining either an outside shed or a stand-alone garage. The lot area of the estate also partially defines if you can develop the current buildings inside the property lines or attach new constructions on your land. Town codes and state laws are implemented, so constantly be informed of your regional codes and laws.\n\n\n\nHow to Obtain the Property Lot Size\n\n\n\nIf you aren\u2019t certain regarding the lot size, yearly tax latest updates and additional state-generated data may give the lot measurement simultaneously with the other important information. The state records department in your town will own your primary lot size.\n\n\n\nThese are standard offices, so you can be assured that you know the accurate lot size to apply in any legal potential you may require.\n\n\n\nKeeping It Standard\n\n\n\nIf you want to determine lot dimensions for legitimate reasons or to market your assets, then you&#8217;ll be required to hold some necessary records in place. Be sure you possess the following:\n\n\n\nDeedTitle reportProper surveys that were hired by you or past buyers/sellers&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow to Understand the Deed\n\n\n\nThe deed will include a summary of the resources and the measurement of all of the lot\u2019s edges. For a little fee, the state records department can print out a photocopy of the deed if you do not possess one on file. Or, you might be able to obtain it online.\n\n\n\nThe property papers or preceding title report will constitute a scale plan that provides the capital and the enclosing lot borders. If the estate survey report was successfully finished, then it will additionally show the surrounding property lines, in more detail.\n\n\n\nThe division assessor office\u2019s standard website may have an online photocopy of tax documents and lot sizes. This can save you money and time.\n\n\n\nHow to Measure the Lot Size\n\n\n\nOnce you have hunted down all the necessary papers, you should get down to the features and estimate the lot size. Plot out the edges of the estate on paper.\n\n\n\nDistribute the sketch that you have pulled into the most simplistic configurations that the original land lines provide. If you possess a square lot, distribute the drawings into a square. For an unevenly shaped lot like those observed in provincial or undeveloped commercial sectors, you can distribute the sketch of the property into an asymmetrical polygon into two triangles.\n\n\n\nPractice a roll-out mapping tool to estimate any unknown limits and write these figures down in the relevant area of the design. A roll-out mapping tool is official for mapping a land line. They are free online and can value around $5 to higher than $100.\n\n\n\nA roll-out mapping tool is a simplistic piece of tools that maximum landowners who have marked a property or other space on their homeland may be familiar with. It seems like a measuring tape on the edge of a stick along with the wheel. Unusual roll-out mapping tools are digital as well as handheld. To practice these, understand the directions and steps because every manufacturer has distinctive designs.\n\n\n\nMeasure Lot Size\n\n\n\nRule rectangle and square lots and then simply multiply the width limits by the length.To determine the area of a triangle-shaped lot, multiply the height of that particular triangle by its base and then divide the outcome by 2.Sum up the area of all shapes to reach the total size of the lot.\n\n\n\nUtilize these estimates to determine the area of the lot.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\nTips to Beautify your bedroom15 Best Pop Ceiling Design for Hall with 2 FansAverage sizes of apartments come down by 27% in 5 years- The definitive moment for affordable housingProperty buyers now seek bigger apartments in major Indian citiesImpact of Demonetization of Currency notes on Primary Real Estate in India\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n\n        \n            \n\t\t\t\tHow is BHK measured?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn simplistic terms, it is the whole area in one&#8217;s flat where one can place the carpet.

You can also pay stamp duty online or at the registry office. Below are the mentioned rates for stamp duty at a few states-</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>State</strong></td><td><strong>Stamp Duty</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Delhi</td><td>Men: 6% Women: 4%</td></tr><tr><td>Maharashtra</td><td>Agricultural land/ residential property:&nbsp;&nbsp; INR 200 Family members: 3% Other relatives: 5% &nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Gujarat</td><td>4.9% of the market value</td></tr><tr><td>Punjab</td><td>Family members: NIL Non-family members: 6%</td></tr><tr><td>Karnataka</td><td>Family members: INR 1,000- 5,000 Non-family members: 5.6% of the land value</td></tr><tr><td>Tamil Nadu</td><td>Family members: 1% Non-family: 7%</td></tr><tr><td>Rajasthan</td><td>Men: 5% Women: 4% and 3% Immediate family: 2.5% For spouse: 1% Widow: None SC/ST or BPL: 3% &nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>West Bengal</td><td>Family members: 0.5% Non-family members: 6% More than Rs 40 lakh: Surcharge of 1%</td></tr><tr><td>Uttar Pradesh</td><td>Men: 7% Women: 6%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-gift-deeds-and-tax-implication\"><strong>GIFT DEEDS AND TAX IMPLICATION</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Gift Deeds</strong> must be reported on an income tax return (ITR). In 1998, the Gift Tax Act of 1958 was repealed, but it came into force again in 2004. If the amount of stamp duty exceeds INR 50,000 and the property received does not obtain the required allowance, the tax implication would be enormous. For example, the tax rebate is INR 1.5 Lakhs, and the stamp duty is INR 4 lakhs, then the penultimate difference between is more than INR 50,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-to-revoke-a-gift-deed\"><strong>HOW TO REVOKE A GIFT DEED</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">According to Article 126 of the &#8220;Transfer of Property Act&#8221;, the gift contract can be revoked if the following conditions are met:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The donor and the recipient agree to cancel the donation.</li><li>The transfer of ownership is based only on the wishes of the one who transfers the said gift deed, and the receiver is unwilling to accept the assets.</li><li>For property created as part of a gift, this situation is not illegal or immoral. This means that the gift is not fraudulent. However, legal counsel should be sought to clear the underlying process.</li><li>Remember, once the gift contract is ready, it cannot be revoked unless a revocation clause is added. Be sure to add an &#8220;exit clause&#8221; to avoid complications in the future.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>CAN A GIFT DEED BE ALLOWED TO REGISTER IN A PERSON\u2019S PRIVATE RESIDENCE</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Article 31 of the Registration Act, it herein allows the registrar to visit the apartment or home of a person who wants to submit a <strong>gift deed certificate</strong> as evidence of a special reason (such as a physical disability).

The act of transfer enables a person to vacate or transfer their legal ownership of the property. However, in the deed of relinquishment, the transferred property is always hereditary, and the gifted asset is not necessarily hereditary. The person to whom the property is relinquished must be the co-owner of the property. In the case of a gifted property, anyone can do so by giving explicit favour to the property itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-format-of-a-gift-deed-sample\"><strong>FORMAT OF A GIFT DEED: SAMPLE</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-31339\" width=\"385\" height=\"501\" srcset=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-1.png 385w, https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-1-231x300.png 231w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-conclusion\"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">On a voluntary basis, <strong>gift deeds</strong> are an effective legal tool for the smooth transfer of property in India.

Below are the mentioned rates for stamp duty at a few states-\n\n\n\nStateStamp DutyDelhiMen: 6% Women: 4%MaharashtraAgricultural land/ residential property:&nbsp;&nbsp; INR 200 Family members: 3% Other relatives: 5% &nbsp;Gujarat4.9% of the market valuePunjabFamily members: NIL Non-family members: 6%KarnatakaFamily members: INR 1,000- 5,000 Non-family members: 5.6% of the land valueTamil NaduFamily members: 1% Non-family: 7%RajasthanMen: 5% Women: 4% and 3% Immediate family: 2.5% For spouse: 1% Widow: None SC/ST or BPL: 3% &nbsp;West BengalFamily members: 0.5% Non-family members: 6% More than Rs 40 lakh: Surcharge of 1%Uttar PradeshMen: 7% Women: 6%\n\n\n\nGIFT DEEDS AND TAX IMPLICATION\n\n\n\nGift Deeds must be reported on an income tax return (ITR). In 1998, the Gift Tax Act of 1958 was repealed, but it came into force again in 2004. If the amount of stamp duty exceeds INR 50,000 and the property received does not obtain the required allowance, the tax implication would be enormous. For example, the tax rebate is INR 1.5 Lakhs, and the stamp duty is INR 4 lakhs, then the penultimate difference between is more than INR 50,000.\n\n\n\nHOW TO REVOKE A GIFT DEED\n\n\n\nAccording to Article 126 of the &#8220;Transfer of Property Act&#8221;, the gift contract can be revoked if the following conditions are met:\n\n\n\nThe donor and the recipient agree to cancel the donation.The transfer of ownership is based only on the wishes of the one who transfers the said gift deed, and the receiver is unwilling to accept the assets.For property created as part of a gift, this situation is not illegal or immoral. This means that the gift is not fraudulent. However, legal counsel should be sought to clear the underlying process.Remember, once the gift contract is ready, it cannot be revoked unless a revocation clause is added. Be sure to add an &#8220;exit clause&#8221; to avoid complications in the future.\n\n\n\nCAN A GIFT DEED BE ALLOWED TO REGISTER IN A PERSON\u2019S PRIVATE RESIDENCE\n\n\n\nAccording to Article 31 of the Registration Act, it herein allows the registrar to visit the apartment or home of a person who wants to submit a gift deed certificate as evidence of a special reason (such as a physical disability). To register and accept this type of deed, the person in charge of the record must be convinced that the specific reasons provided are sufficient.\n\n\n\nRELINQUISHMENT DEEDS AND GIFT DEEDS\n\n\n\nRelinquishment deeds and gifts are different types of property transfer in the eyes of the law. The act of transfer enables a person to vacate or transfer their legal ownership of the property. However, in the deed of relinquishment, the transferred property is always hereditary, and the gifted asset is not necessarily hereditary. The person to whom the property is relinquished must be the co-owner of the property. In the case of a gifted property, anyone can do so by giving explicit favour to the property itself.\n\n\n\nFORMAT OF A GIFT DEED: SAMPLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nOn a voluntary basis, gift deeds are an effective legal tool for the smooth transfer of property in India. It also comes with Tax exemption within certain limits. In addition, it is exempt from sales tax and central tax. The main takeaway is that it is autonomous and does not mean any monetary reward; however, it should be noted that additional stamp duty on a gift deed, which may vary from state to state.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\nStamp Duty and Registration Charges in MumbaiChoosing the Best Gift for Griha Pravesh: Some Top IdeasSection 194IA of Income Tax Act &amp; its TDS implications on Property PurchaseGIFT will be a boost to the Residential Market of Ahmedabad and Gandhi NagarIndia\u2019s First Ever District Cooling System Revolutionizes GIFT City\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n\n        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhat are the main things recorded for a gift deed?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt should primarily state that the donor is gifting voluntarily, and there is no external/internal influence or coercion for the same.

            "content_html": "\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">With over a million people in India using mobile phones, there is an ongoing need to build new cell phone towers to improve network coverage and combat call dropouts. As the world becomes more urbanized, the number of places where a mobile phone tower may be built is shrinking. As a result, high-rise building rooftops are one of the few remaining choices for mobile tower placement. The owners receive a significant amount of <strong>rent from mobile tower installation</strong>.&nbsp; On the other hand, <strong>mobile tower installation in a housing society</strong> is not a simple activity that a property owner may decide to do one day. Apart from <strong>the impact of mobile tower installation on rental income</strong>, several other factors come into play. The <strong>impact of the mobile tower on health</strong> as well as the <strong>impact of the mobile tower on property</strong> needs to be taken into due consideration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Towers are frequently installed in apartment complexes by mobile phone carriers.&nbsp; Because each structure is multiple stories tall, they are ideal locations for mobile tower installation. Before installation in India, several rules and regulations, as well as government and privacy policies, must be assessed, and the guidelines given by <strong>ICNIRP</strong> must be followed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-tower-positioning\"><strong>Tower Positioning</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The first thing to know is that tower construction in residential zones is not prohibited. But if there is not a choice, a skyscraper can be built in a residential neighborhood. It&#8217;s also worth noting that if a tower must be built in a residential neighborhood, it should only be on building rooftops. Even then, open areas or public buildings should be the preferred locations for installation. A tower on the roof of a strictly residential structure will be built only after all other possibilities have been exhausted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The best places to put up a mobile tower are in the woods or on open terrain. In such instances, cordoning off the area surrounding the tower is recommended to ensure that humans or animals cannot enter the perimeter limits.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-paperwork\"><strong>Paperwork</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Something as crucial as mobile tower installation, adequate paperwork and procedures are required. Only after receiving explicit authorization from the sanctioning authority may a mobile tower be installed. Even government-owned cell phone towers must adhere to strict guidelines before being installed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-is-your-cell-tower-up-and-running-after-getting-authorization-from-the-proper-authorities\"><strong>Is your cell tower up and running after getting authorization from the proper authorities?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Commissioners of Municipal Corporations, Chief Officers of Town Municipal Councils, Commissioners of City Municipal Councils, Panchayat Development Officers in Urban Development Authority zones, and Town Panchayats are all examples of sanctioning authorities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">While preparing papers, it&#8217;s vital to understand what a mobile tower entails: Ground-Based Towers, Roof Top Towers, Roof Top Poles, Cell Phone Towers, Antenna Fixtures, Fabricated antennas, Transmission Towers, Cell On Wheels, In-Building Solutions, and Micro Sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following is a list of papers that must be provided to obtain clearance for the installation of a mobile tower:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>location, as well as the businesses in the area. It is against the law to build skyscrapers near schools or hospitals.</li><li>A site plan depicting plot size, number and height of structures, and plot access.</li><li>A structural Stability certificate from a licensed structural engineer is required. The structure must be able to support the weight of the mobile tower.</li><li>A copy of the building&#8217;s sanctioned plan, as well as a valid occupancy certificate, is required.</li><li>Documents proving ownership.</li><li>Both parties (application and building owner) have consented to the installation in the lease agreement.</li><li>Drawing of a skyscraper with foundation details and design specifications.</li><li>The tower&#8217;s height, as well as elevation information.</li><li>Documentation specifying the distance between tower and lines is required if there is high- or low-tension electrical wire around the proposed location.</li><li>The weight of the tower in metric tonnes.</li><li>Indemnity bond admitting responsibility for any mishaps caused by this installation and promising to provide any necessary compensation.</li><li>A letter from the fire department declaring that they have no objections.</li><li>Copies of all required papers demonstrating adherence to the Environment (Protection) Act of 1986.</li><li>A copy of the clearance from the Standing Advisory Committee on Radio Frequency Allocations, as well as a commitment that if difficulties arise, remedial steps will be implemented, or the tower will be dismantled.</li><li>Receipts from TERM cells or any other comparable authority confirming that all public locations are under acceptable Electromagnetic Radiation exposure limits.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Approaching tower firms directly is the best strategy to rent out your land for mobile tower installation. Indus Tower, Viom Rite, Bharti Infratel, and American Tower Corporation are just a few of the alternatives accessible online. In the past, these firms oversaw tower development initiatives in several nations. You may also go to the Department of Telecommunications&#8217; website to learn more about the firms that provide mobile tower installation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">You may provide the telecom providers with information about your property and invite them to inspect it. However, keep in mind that the firms will only contact you if your home meets the radio frequency requirements. If the site receives a green light, a series of Memorandums of Understanding (MoU) is signed, and the property is then leased to various telecom service providers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-sanction-on-documents\"><strong>Sanction on Documents</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Within 30 days, the permission for the tower&#8217;s installation should be approved. It will take two years to complete. In the event of non-completion, the permit can be renewed for a charge if applied before the original permission expires. They must be listed in the official gazette within three months of their installation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-advantages\"><strong>Advantages</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>a consistent source of revenue</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">&nbsp;The monthly rental from a mobile tower installation may be anything between Rs 8,000 and Rs one lakh. Rentals in major areas such as Mumbai might reach several lakhs. However, the sum may vary depending on the property&#8217;s height, size, and location. The owners get a significant amount of <strong>rent from the installation of mobile towers</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-long-term-gain\"><strong>Long term gain</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The lease on a mobile tower might last anywhere from a few months to a few years, but the owner can prolong it to get a long-term advantage. Furthermore, the newly erected tower may have a favourable influence on property prices. When contrasted to other similar properties in the region, properties with mobile tower installation see a 10-15 percent increase in their typical capital values.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-extra-perks\"><strong>Extra Perks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Towers in residential buildings may sometimes be advantageous to the property owner, not just in terms of monthly rentals and terms of free phone calls and internet access. If the property owner utilizes the same mobile network, there is also the benefit of enhanced network service with less downtime. Some property owners also see a beneficial <strong>impact of mobile tower installation on rental income</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-cons\"><strong>Cons</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-health-risks\"><strong>Health Risks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Regarding the <strong>impact of mobile tower installation on health</strong>, there are two theories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">According to studies, those exposed to radiation from cell phone towers are more likely to be diagnosed with cancer. At the same time, research suggests that the shadow zone does not get as much radiation as previously thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">According to the American Cancer Society, the significant <strong>impact of mobile tower installation on health</strong> can lead to problems like headaches, memory loss, congenital impairments, and cardiovascular stress. Many studies have also shown that cell towers, which transmit non-ionizing, high Radio Frequency (RF) radiation, may cause cancer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Some individuals are concerned that living, working, or going to school near a mobile phone tower might raise their risk of cancer or other health issues. There is currently little evidence to support this theory. In principle, there are several compelling arguments against cellular phone towers&#8217; ability to cause cancer:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>For starters, radiofrequency (RF) waves have a low-intensity level compared to other forms of radiation that are associated with causing cancer, such as gamma rays and ultraviolet (UV) light. Because the intensity of RF waves emitted by cell phone towers is insufficient to break covalent bonds in DNA molecules, these greater types of radiation may cause cancer.</li><li>The wavelength is a second problem. Long wavelengths of RF waves can only be focused to a size of an inch or two. As a result, it&#8217;s doubtful that RF waves&#8217; energy will be focused sufficiently to impact specific cells in the body.</li><li>Third, even if RF waves might harm cells in the body at greater doses, the energy levels emitted by RF waves near mobile phone towers are not considerably different from the background levels of RF radiation emitted by other sources in metropolitan areas, such as radio and television broadcast stations.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>While some oncologists have said that RF waves are not carcinogenic (cancer-causing), long-term exposure to such waves is harmful to inhabitants&#8217; health.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-affects-the-property-s-aesthetic-value\"><strong>Affects the property&#8217;s aesthetic value</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Tall cell towers on your terrace or land/plot may detract from the property&#8217;s visual appeal, especially in beautiful locations. This downside is one of the <strong>impacts of mobile tower installation on property</strong> that owners consider before deciding. Despite many attempts by cellular providers to conceal the towers or construct smaller towers, the notion does not appear to fit ineffectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-to-stop-installation\"><strong>How to Stop Installation?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">India is a densely populated and human-rich country, with people inhabiting every nook and cranny. Because one person carries multiple phones, mobile phone usage is high in comparison to the population. Mobile phones have grown so inexpensive that they are accessible to both the affluent and the poor. As a result, mobile service providers are compelled to make <strong>mobile tower installations in housing societies</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">However, owing to the increased demand for internet and mobile service, service providers began to construct towers everywhere, including hospitals, schools, and other public buildings. This creates unease and concerns among the general population, who are concerned about their health and emotional well-being. When weighed against the benefits, mobile towers have certain drawbacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Because of the Telecom Act of 1996, stopping the building of mobile towers on your property is not an easy process. This statute allows service providers to erect towers provided they can prove that a restricted radio signal region exists.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-steps\"><strong>Steps:</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Write a letter requesting that the mobile tower installation in your neighbourhood be halted and get the signatures of at least 50 individuals who live on the property.</li><li>Submit a plea to your local Sub District Magistrate or Joint Commissioner to have the tower erection halted.</li><li>Try to persuade them of the challenges and problems that may arise because of the tower&#8217;s installation.</li><li>Don&#8217;t submit your request by yourself. Take a few of the individuals with you to persuade them.</li><li>The authorities would instruct the mobile service firms not to construct the tower if your request was approved and reviewed.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-conclusion\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">With changing circumstances and expanding options, renting a home is one of the most effective methods to supplement your income. A property can be rented in various ways, including for ad shots, holiday houses, homestays, contractual rentals, and office space. However, in any of the foregoing circumstances, finding a decent renter and securing a regular income might be difficult. As a result, despite the <strong>impacts of mobile tower installation on a property</strong>, property owners are opting for alternative lucrative choices such as availing the <strong>impacts of mobile tower installation on rental income</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">With the number of cell phone users and fierce competition, cellular providers are eager to spread their services to every part of the country. As a result, mobile firms are negotiating with property owners to build a cellular tower on their property in exchange for monthly rent. However, while the offer appears appealing, <strong>mobile tower installation in housing societies </strong>is not without flaws. The argument on the <strong>impact of mobile tower installation on health</strong> is due for its final verdict.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-you-might-also-like\">You Might Also Like</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-yoast-seo-related-links\"><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/installing-gypsum-false-ceilings-here-are-a-few-tips\">Installing gypsum false ceilings?

            "content_text": "With over a million people in India using mobile phones, there is an ongoing need to build new cell phone towers to improve network coverage and combat call dropouts. As the world becomes more urbanized, the number of places where a mobile phone tower may be built is shrinking. As a result, high-rise building rooftops are one of the few remaining choices for mobile tower placement. The owners receive a significant amount of rent from mobile tower installation.&nbsp; On the other hand, mobile tower installation in a housing society is not a simple activity that a property owner may decide to do one day. Apart from the impact of mobile tower installation on rental income, several other factors come into play. The impact of the mobile tower on health as well as the impact of the mobile tower on property needs to be taken into due consideration.\n\n\n\nTowers are frequently installed in apartment complexes by mobile phone carriers.&nbsp; Because each structure is multiple stories tall, they are ideal locations for mobile tower installation. Before installation in India, several rules and regulations, as well as government and privacy policies, must be assessed, and the guidelines given by ICNIRP must be followed.\n\n\n\nTower Positioning\n\n\n\nThe first thing to know is that tower construction in residential zones is not prohibited. But if there is not a choice, a skyscraper can be built in a residential neighborhood. It&#8217;s also worth noting that if a tower must be built in a residential neighborhood, it should only be on building rooftops. Even then, open areas or public buildings should be the preferred locations for installation. A tower on the roof of a strictly residential structure will be built only after all other possibilities have been exhausted.\n\n\n\nThe best places to put up a mobile tower are in the woods or on open terrain. In such instances, cordoning off the area surrounding the tower is recommended to ensure that humans or animals cannot enter the perimeter limits.\n\n\n\nPaperwork\n\n\n\nSomething as crucial as mobile tower installation, adequate paperwork and procedures are required. Only after receiving explicit authorization from the sanctioning authority may a mobile tower be installed. Even government-owned cell phone towers must adhere to strict guidelines before being installed.\n\n\n\nIs your cell tower up and running after getting authorization from the proper authorities?\n\n\n\nCommissioners of Municipal Corporations, Chief Officers of Town Municipal Councils, Commissioners of City Municipal Councils, Panchayat Development Officers in Urban Development Authority zones, and Town Panchayats are all examples of sanctioning authorities.\n\n\n\nWhile preparing papers, it&#8217;s vital to understand what a mobile tower entails: Ground-Based Towers, Roof Top Towers, Roof Top Poles, Cell Phone Towers, Antenna Fixtures, Fabricated antennas, Transmission Towers, Cell On Wheels, In-Building Solutions, and Micro Sites.\n\n\n\nThe following is a list of papers that must be provided to obtain clearance for the installation of a mobile tower:\n\n\n\nlocation, as well as the businesses in the area. It is against the law to build skyscrapers near schools or hospitals.A site plan depicting plot size, number and height of structures, and plot access.A structural Stability certificate from a licensed structural engineer is required. The structure must be able to support the weight of the mobile tower.A copy of the building&#8217;s sanctioned plan, as well as a valid occupancy certificate, is required.Documents proving ownership.Both parties (application and building owner) have consented to the installation in the lease agreement.Drawing of a skyscraper with foundation details and design specifications.The tower&#8217;s height, as well as elevation information.Documentation specifying the distance between tower and lines is required if there is high- or low-tension electrical wire around the proposed location.The weight of the tower in metric tonnes.Indemnity bond admitting responsibility for any mishaps caused by this installation and promising to provide any necessary compensation.A letter from the fire department declaring that they have no objections.Copies of all required papers demonstrating adherence to the Environment (Protection) Act of 1986.A copy of the clearance from the Standing Advisory Committee on Radio Frequency Allocations, as well as a commitment that if difficulties arise, remedial steps will be implemented, or the tower will be dismantled.Receipts from TERM cells or any other comparable authority confirming that all public locations are under acceptable Electromagnetic Radiation exposure limits.\n\n\n\nApproaching tower firms directly is the best strategy to rent out your land for mobile tower installation. Indus Tower, Viom Rite, Bharti Infratel, and American Tower Corporation are just a few of the alternatives accessible online. In the past, these firms oversaw tower development initiatives in several nations. You may also go to the Department of Telecommunications&#8217; website to learn more about the firms that provide mobile tower installation.\n\n\n\nYou may provide the telecom providers with information about your property and invite them to inspect it. However, keep in mind that the firms will only contact you if your home meets the radio frequency requirements. If the site receives a green light, a series of Memorandums of Understanding (MoU) is signed, and the property is then leased to various telecom service providers.\n\n\n\nSanction on Documents\n\n\n\nWithin 30 days, the permission for the tower&#8217;s installation should be approved. It will take two years to complete. In the event of non-completion, the permit can be renewed for a charge if applied before the original permission expires. They must be listed in the official gazette within three months of their installation.\n\n\n\nAdvantages\n\n\n\na consistent source of revenue\n\n\n\n&nbsp;The monthly rental from a mobile tower installation may be anything between Rs 8,000 and Rs one lakh. Rentals in major areas such as Mumbai might reach several lakhs. However, the sum may vary depending on the property&#8217;s height, size, and location. The owners get a significant amount of rent from the installation of mobile towers.\n\n\n\nLong term gain\n\n\n\nThe lease on a mobile tower might last anywhere from a few months to a few years, but the owner can prolong it to get a long-term advantage. Furthermore, the newly erected tower may have a favourable influence on property prices. When contrasted to other similar properties in the region, properties with mobile tower installation see a 10-15 percent increase in their typical capital values.\n\n\n\nExtra Perks\n\n\n\nTowers in residential buildings may sometimes be advantageous to the property owner, not just in terms of monthly rentals and terms of free phone calls and internet access. If the property owner utilizes the same mobile network, there is also the benefit of enhanced network service with less downtime. Some property owners also see a beneficial impact of mobile tower installation on rental income.\n\n\n\nCons\n\n\n\nHealth Risks\n\n\n\nRegarding the impact of mobile tower installation on health, there are two theories.\n\n\n\nAccording to studies, those exposed to radiation from cell phone towers are more likely to be diagnosed with cancer. At the same time, research suggests that the shadow zone does not get as much radiation as previously thought.\n\n\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, the significant impact of mobile tower installation on health can lead to problems like headaches, memory loss, congenital impairments, and cardiovascular stress. Many studies have also shown that cell towers, which transmit non-ionizing, high Radio Frequency (RF) radiation, may cause cancer.\n\n\n\nSome individuals are concerned that living, working, or going to school near a mobile phone tower might raise their risk of cancer or other health issues. There is currently little evidence to support this theory. In principle, there are several compelling arguments against cellular phone towers&#8217; ability to cause cancer:\n\n\n\nFor starters, radiofrequency (RF) waves have a low-intensity level compared to other forms of radiation that are associated with causing cancer, such as gamma rays and ultraviolet (UV) light. Because the intensity of RF waves emitted by cell phone towers is insufficient to break covalent bonds in DNA molecules, these greater types of radiation may cause cancer.The wavelength is a second problem. Long wavelengths of RF waves can only be focused to a size of an inch or two. As a result, it&#8217;s doubtful that RF waves&#8217; energy will be focused sufficiently to impact specific cells in the body.Third, even if RF waves might harm cells in the body at greater doses, the energy levels emitted by RF waves near mobile phone towers are not considerably different from the background levels of RF radiation emitted by other sources in metropolitan areas, such as radio and television broadcast stations.\n\n\n\nWhile some oncologists have said that RF waves are not carcinogenic (cancer-causing), long-term exposure to such waves is harmful to inhabitants&#8217; health.\n\n\n\nAffects the property&#8217;s aesthetic value\n\n\n\nTall cell towers on your terrace or land/plot may detract from the property&#8217;s visual appeal, especially in beautiful locations. This downside is one of the impacts of mobile tower installation on property that owners consider before deciding. Despite many attempts by cellular providers to conceal the towers or construct smaller towers, the notion does not appear to fit ineffectively.\n\n\n\nHow to Stop Installation?\n\n\n\nIndia is a densely populated and human-rich country, with people inhabiting every nook and cranny. Because one person carries multiple phones, mobile phone usage is high in comparison to the population. Mobile phones have grown so inexpensive that they are accessible to both the affluent and the poor. As a result, mobile service providers are compelled to make mobile tower installations in housing societies.\n\n\n\nHowever, owing to the increased demand for internet and mobile service, service providers began to construct towers everywhere, including hospitals, schools, and other public buildings. This creates unease and concerns among the general population, who are concerned about their health and emotional well-being. When weighed against the benefits, mobile towers have certain drawbacks.\n\n\n\nBecause of the Telecom Act of 1996, stopping the building of mobile towers on your property is not an easy process. This statute allows service providers to erect towers provided they can prove that a restricted radio signal region exists.\n\n\n\nSteps:\n\n\n\nWrite a letter requesting that the mobile tower installation in your neighbourhood be halted and get the signatures of at least 50 individuals who live on the property.Submit a plea to your local Sub District Magistrate or Joint Commissioner to have the tower erection halted.Try to persuade them of the challenges and problems that may arise because of the tower&#8217;s installation.Don&#8217;t submit your request by yourself. Take a few of the individuals with you to persuade them.The authorities would instruct the mobile service firms not to construct the tower if your request was approved and reviewed.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nWith changing circumstances and expanding options, renting a home is one of the most effective methods to supplement your income. A property can be rented in various ways, including for ad shots, holiday houses, homestays, contractual rentals, and office space. However, in any of the foregoing circumstances, finding a decent renter and securing a regular income might be difficult. As a result, despite the impacts of mobile tower installation on a property, property owners are opting for alternative lucrative choices such as availing the impacts of mobile tower installation on rental income.\n\n\n\nWith the number of cell phone users and fierce competition, cellular providers are eager to spread their services to every part of the country. As a result, mobile firms are negotiating with property owners to build a cellular tower on their property in exchange for monthly rent. However, while the offer appears appealing, mobile tower installation in housing societies is not without flaws. The argument on the impact of mobile tower installation on health is due for its final verdict.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\nInstalling gypsum false ceilings?

            "content_html": "\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">To interconnect all of the Delhi metro networks, the Delhi Metro Railway Corporation (DMRC) designed the Pink Line corridor. The Pink Line is explicitly the part of the Delhi Metro Phase III, which is currently divided into two parts: Majlis Park for Mayur Vihar Pocket I, and Trilokpuri corridor to Shiv Vihar. The missing link connecting Trilokpuri and Mayur Vihar is expected to be functional between factories by June 2021, according to DMRC officials. So far, due to land acquisition issues, the lawsuit has been pending. Once put into operation, it will become the longest subway corridor in Delhi, forming a loop and having interchange hubs to all existing routes. Part of the Delhi pink metro line connecting Majlis Park and Durgabai Deshmukh South Campus will be put into operation on Wednesday. The passenger flow is expected to start at 6:00 pm.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-a-few-nitty-gritty-of-the-pink-line\">A Few Nitty-Gritty Of The Pink Line</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The corridor, also known as the ring road, will extend from the Majlis Park in the northwest of Delhi to Shiv Vihar in the northeast of Delhi. After completion, it will be 58.59 kilometers in length and start from Delhi along the ring road. The pink line is also the highest- Dhaula Kuan will be the highest point of the site with a height of 23.6 meters; of which 39.48 kilometers above ground and 19.11 kilometers underground.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-transfer\">Transfer</h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">One of the most significant features of this section is the numerous interchangeable stations. This corridor strategically passes through stations that connect almost all existing and future subway lines in Delhi, including the yellow, red, green, blue, orange, and purple lines, as well as Hazrat Nizamuddin, Anand Vihar (Indian Railways) and ISBT-Terminals at Anand Vihar and Sarai Kale Khan.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-technology\">Technology</h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The Delhi Metro Pink Line will be the most technologically advanced part of Delhi\u2019s many subway corridors. This part will use standard gauges and will be equipped with unattended or unattended trains (UTO). These train drivers will eventually be transformed into technological manifestos. This section will also adopt a new signal technology called Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC). According to DMRC, CBTC technology improves signal coordination between trains from different directions. They have a direct effect on train frequency.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-situation\">Situation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">According to DMRC officials, this is &#8220;the most difficult corridor in the third stage.&#8221; The company faces challenges in the areas of technology, technological issues, and land acquisition. DMRC said in a statement: &#8220;In addition to construction issues, land acquisition in Mayapuri and Punjabi Bagh has also become a bottleneck in the construction process. There are also major bypasses between Shakurpur and Mayapuri, such as laying drainage pipes. Near Mayapuri, DMRC is also facing construction and traffic management issues in Patparganj, Anand Vihar, Welcome, Jafrabad and Maujpur.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-additional-extension-of-the-pink-line\">Additional extension of the Pink Line</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">In the fourth phase, the Pink Line will run from Maujpur-Babarpur to Majlis Park. Therefore, if you have to travel between two stations, you don&#8217;t have to go around the entire route and the virtual circle of Delhi. You only need to take the train across the Yamuna River to reach the destination.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-ways-of-the-delhi-metro-pink-line\">Ways of the Delhi Metro Pink Line</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The Pink Line is nearly 59 kilometers long and connects the Majlis Park in the northwest of Delhi with Shiv Vihar in the northeast of Delhi, making it the longest metro line in Delhi. It also has the smallest metro station in the country in Ashram and the highest point of the Delhi Metro in Dhaula Quan. The Pink Line is composed of 26 elevated stations and 12 subway stations. The highest point of Daola Spring is 23.6 meters, and it is seven stories high.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-interchanging-of-the-lines\">Interchanging of the Lines</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The Pink Line of the Delhi Metro provides connections to all other existing and future lines, and interchange options are available at 12 of the 38 stations. The following stations have pink line intersections:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Netaji Subhash Place and Welcome-Red Line</li><li>INA and Azadpur-Yellow Line</li><li>Punjabi Bagh West-Green Line</li><li>Karkarduma and Anand Vihar- Blue Line</li><li>Wazirabad Surghat and Lajpat Nagar- Violet Line</li><li>Durgabai Deshmukh South Campus-Orange Line (Airport Line)</li><li>Azadpur and Majlis Park- Magenta line</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The Footbridge (FOB) opened to traffic on February 9, 2019, connecting Durgabai Deshmukh South Campus Station on the Delhi Metro Pink Line and Dhaula Kuan Metro Station on the Airport Express Line. Residents of East Delhi, West Delhi, and North Delhi can go to Delhi Airport and New Delhi Railway Station.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-delhi-metro-pink-line-structure-development\">Delhi Metro Pink Line: Structure Development</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The Delhi Pink Metro Line was opened to traffic in four phases from March to December 2018. However, due to land purchase problems in some areas, the first completion date in December 2016 could not be completed as scheduled. The deadline was postponed till April 2018. The pink line was subsequently constructed one by one and finally completed in December 2018 with the opening of the Lajpat Nagar-Mayur Vihar Pocket I corridor. The Pink Line was put into operation from March to December 2018 in the following phases:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>March 14th, 2018</strong>: Majlis Park-South Durgabai Deshmuk Campus<br><strong>August 6th, 2018</strong>: Durgabai Deshmuk South Campus-Lajpat Nagar<br><strong>October 31st, 2018</strong>: Trilokpuri Sanjay Lake-Shiv Vihar<br><strong>December 31st, 2018</strong>: Lajpat Nagar-Mayur Vihar Pocket I</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">After the 17.8-kilometer pink Shiv Vihar-Trilokpuri Sanjay line was accessible to the public on October 31, 2018. Delhi has entered the global selected city clusters such as London and Shanghai, which have subway network functions for over 300 km. Since the opening of the last corridor in December 2018, Delhi&#8217;s metro network has expanded to nearly 327 kilometers, including 236 stations. The Pink Line Corridor opened on December 31, 2018, with a total length of 9.7 kilometers, connecting Mayur Vihar Pocket I and Lajpat Nagar. There are five stations along the way: Ashram, Vinoba Puri, Mayur Vihar Phase I, Mayur Vihar Pocket I, and Hazrat Nizamuddin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Although the part between Trilokpuri and Mayur Vihar Pocket I has been completed, the next phase has not yet begun. DMRC announced that the construction work on the missing section has been completed. It is expected that the remaining work, such as laying tracks and auxiliary components, is still in progress. This section was originally scheduled to open in September 2020, but it was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Mangu Singh, managing director of DMRC, now announces that the missing link will be put into use in March 2021, and test drives on the 1.5-kilometer section will begin soon. The total span of the ongoing project is 289 meters, and the bracket supporting the viaduct has been erected in 2020. When completed, the pink connection viaduct will connect most of East Delhi along with the south and west corridors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Trilokpuri is a densely populated residential area, and the land required to build 10 subway towers is not enough. Residents of Block 15 and 108 plots must be relocated to provide the necessary land for the construction of the missing viaduct. Most residents of the apartment which was built nearby have given tenders for the immediate construction of the missing link during 2019. Although the work is in progress, due to protests from farmers on the Delhi border, construction materials from other states cannot arrive on time, such as prefabricated steel beams for important construction materials in Punjab. The border has caused some drag on the project, but DMRC remains confident to close the gap by March.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-delhi-metro-pink-line-fare-schedule\">Delhi Metro Pink Line fare schedule</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The Delhi Metro fare is set. It all depends on where the journey starts and where it ends.

The two lines are currently crossing, but there is no breakpoint. &#8220;What this new project will do is unique,&#8221; a senior official said on Thursday, adding that people had asked to provide a crossing point. &#8220;The Delhi Metro is adding a transfer station (halt station) on the green line 5, which in turn will connect the Green Line and the Pink Line-Line 7 (Shiv Vihar- Majlis Park) at the Punjabi Bagh West Metro Station on the Pink Line,&#8221; the DMRC stated in a report. The first and last trains between Hoshiar Singh Brigade (Bahadurgarh) and Inderlok / Kirtinagar (Line 5) will be controlled from midnight on June 18th to 19th to September 30th, train officials said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">&#8216;This is the first time that a special platform is planned to connect two underground corridors that are already in use. The station will present a connection between the Green Line and the Pink Line at the Punjabi Bagh Metro Station,&#8221; said Anuj Dayal, executive director of corporate communications at DMRC. However, he added that the exchange would have no ticket booths. There is currently no connection between the two corridors. This facility is very useful for travelling to and from the satellite city of Bahadurgarh and other remote areas of Delhi, such as Mundka, Nangloi, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The total height from the platform level to the lobby of the Pink Line Punjabi Bagh Station is 16.75 meters, which is why the passage is planned to be two floors. Commuters will have to go towards the platform, which must be reached by stairs, take two escalators, or a continuous lift towards the Lobby area,&#8221; DMRC said in a statement.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-latest-updates\">Latest Updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">According to a recent DMRC statement, the construction work connecting Mayur Vihar and Trilokpuri will be completed. The second phase of work, including laying tracks and assembling other components, will also be completed soon. After the electrification work is completed, it is expected to start functional tests and start operations after security checks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The name of this area will be called the &#8216;Ring Corridor. This line will become the longest corridor in the Delhi Metro network. In March 2021, it was seen that construction could not be completed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Government of India signed a development loan of \u20b9161.86 crores for the Delhi Metro Pink Line Phase IV and three other major metro projects to support the expansion plan of the Delhi Metro Pink Line. Approximately \u20b98,390 crores will be used for the fourth phase of development in Delhi. The subway is the violet line extending from Janakpuri West to RK Ashram (28.92 km) with 25 stations, the silver line from Aerocity to Tughlakabad (23.6 km) has 15 stations, and the pink line from Mukundpur to Majpur (12.58 km) has eight stations. At the same time, Delhi Metro stated that the Pink Line would be driverless in mid-2021.

            "content_text": "To interconnect all of the Delhi metro networks, the Delhi Metro Railway Corporation (DMRC) designed the Pink Line corridor. The Pink Line is explicitly the part of the Delhi Metro Phase III, which is currently divided into two parts: Majlis Park for Mayur Vihar Pocket I, and Trilokpuri corridor to Shiv Vihar. The missing link connecting Trilokpuri and Mayur Vihar is expected to be functional between factories by June 2021, according to DMRC officials. So far, due to land acquisition issues, the lawsuit has been pending. Once put into operation, it will become the longest subway corridor in Delhi, forming a loop and having interchange hubs to all existing routes. Part of the Delhi pink metro line connecting Majlis Park and Durgabai Deshmukh South Campus will be put into operation on Wednesday. The passenger flow is expected to start at 6:00 pm.\n\n\n\nA Few Nitty-Gritty Of The Pink Line\n\n\n\nThe corridor, also known as the ring road, will extend from the Majlis Park in the northwest of Delhi to Shiv Vihar in the northeast of Delhi. After completion, it will be 58.59 kilometers in length and start from Delhi along the ring road. The pink line is also the highest- Dhaula Kuan will be the highest point of the site with a height of 23.6 meters; of which 39.48 kilometers above ground and 19.11 kilometers underground.\n\n\n\nTransfer\n\n\n\nOne of the most significant features of this section is the numerous interchangeable stations. This corridor strategically passes through stations that connect almost all existing and future subway lines in Delhi, including the yellow, red, green, blue, orange, and purple lines, as well as Hazrat Nizamuddin, Anand Vihar (Indian Railways) and ISBT-Terminals at Anand Vihar and Sarai Kale Khan.\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nThe Delhi Metro Pink Line will be the most technologically advanced part of Delhi\u2019s many subway corridors. This part will use standard gauges and will be equipped with unattended or unattended trains (UTO). These train drivers will eventually be transformed into technological manifestos. This section will also adopt a new signal technology called Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC). According to DMRC, CBTC technology improves signal coordination between trains from different directions. They have a direct effect on train frequency.\n\n\n\nSituation\n\n\n\nAccording to DMRC officials, this is &#8220;the most difficult corridor in the third stage.&#8221; The company faces challenges in the areas of technology, technological issues, and land acquisition. DMRC said in a statement: &#8220;In addition to construction issues, land acquisition in Mayapuri and Punjabi Bagh has also become a bottleneck in the construction process. There are also major bypasses between Shakurpur and Mayapuri, such as laying drainage pipes. Near Mayapuri, DMRC is also facing construction and traffic management issues in Patparganj, Anand Vihar, Welcome, Jafrabad and Maujpur.\n\n\n\nAdditional extension of the Pink Line\n\n\n\nIn the fourth phase, the Pink Line will run from Maujpur-Babarpur to Majlis Park. Therefore, if you have to travel between two stations, you don&#8217;t have to go around the entire route and the virtual circle of Delhi. You only need to take the train across the Yamuna River to reach the destination.\n\n\n\nWays of the Delhi Metro Pink Line\n\n\n\nThe Pink Line is nearly 59 kilometers long and connects the Majlis Park in the northwest of Delhi with Shiv Vihar in the northeast of Delhi, making it the longest metro line in Delhi. It also has the smallest metro station in the country in Ashram and the highest point of the Delhi Metro in Dhaula Quan. The Pink Line is composed of 26 elevated stations and 12 subway stations. The highest point of Daola Spring is 23.6 meters, and it is seven stories high.\n\n\n\nInterchanging of the Lines\n\n\n\nThe Pink Line of the Delhi Metro provides connections to all other existing and future lines, and interchange options are available at 12 of the 38 stations. The following stations have pink line intersections:\n\n\n\nNetaji Subhash Place and Welcome-Red LineINA and Azadpur-Yellow LinePunjabi Bagh West-Green LineKarkarduma and Anand Vihar- Blue LineWazirabad Surghat and Lajpat Nagar- Violet LineDurgabai Deshmukh South Campus-Orange Line (Airport Line)Azadpur and Majlis Park- Magenta line\n\n\n\nThe Footbridge (FOB) opened to traffic on February 9, 2019, connecting Durgabai Deshmukh South Campus Station on the Delhi Metro Pink Line and Dhaula Kuan Metro Station on the Airport Express Line. Residents of East Delhi, West Delhi, and North Delhi can go to Delhi Airport and New Delhi Railway Station.\n\n\n\nDelhi Metro Pink Line: Structure Development\n\n\n\nThe Delhi Pink Metro Line was opened to traffic in four phases from March to December 2018. However, due to land purchase problems in some areas, the first completion date in December 2016 could not be completed as scheduled. The deadline was postponed till April 2018. The pink line was subsequently constructed one by one and finally completed in December 2018 with the opening of the Lajpat Nagar-Mayur Vihar Pocket I corridor. The Pink Line was put into operation from March to December 2018 in the following phases:\n\n\n\nMarch 14th, 2018: Majlis Park-South Durgabai Deshmuk CampusAugust 6th, 2018: Durgabai Deshmuk South Campus-Lajpat NagarOctober 31st, 2018: Trilokpuri Sanjay Lake-Shiv ViharDecember 31st, 2018: Lajpat Nagar-Mayur Vihar Pocket I\n\n\n\nAfter the 17.8-kilometer pink Shiv Vihar-Trilokpuri Sanjay line was accessible to the public on October 31, 2018. Delhi has entered the global selected city clusters such as London and Shanghai, which have subway network functions for over 300 km.

The total span of the ongoing project is 289 meters, and the bracket supporting the viaduct has been erected in 2020. When completed, the pink connection viaduct will connect most of East Delhi along with the south and west corridors.\n\n\n\nTrilokpuri is a densely populated residential area, and the land required to build 10 subway towers is not enough. Residents of Block 15 and 108 plots must be relocated to provide the necessary land for the construction of the missing viaduct. Most residents of the apartment which was built nearby have given tenders for the immediate construction of the missing link during 2019. Although the work is in progress, due to protests from farmers on the Delhi border, construction materials from other states cannot arrive on time, such as prefabricated steel beams for important construction materials in Punjab. The border has caused some drag on the project, but DMRC remains confident to close the gap by March.\n\n\n\nDelhi Metro Pink Line fare schedule\n\n\n\nThe Delhi Metro fare is set. It all depends on where the journey starts and where it ends. The lowest fare for the Delhi Metro is \u20b910, and the highest fare is \u20b960.\n\n\n\nConnectivity between the pink and green line\n\n\n\nThe Delhi Metro is building a unique platform to connect the Pink Line and Green Line of the Punjabi Bagh Metro Station.

Commuters will have to go towards the platform, which must be reached by stairs, take two escalators, or a continuous lift towards the Lobby area,&#8221; DMRC said in a statement.\n\n\n\nLatest Updates\n\n\n\nAccording to a recent DMRC statement, the construction work connecting Mayur Vihar and Trilokpuri will be completed. The second phase of work, including laying tracks and assembling other components, will also be completed soon. After the electrification work is completed, it is expected to start functional tests and start operations after security checks.\n\n\n\nThe name of this area will be called the &#8216;Ring Corridor.

            "content_html": "\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">We all know that a<strong> home loan</strong> comprises two components- Interest and Principal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">There are different sections in the tax law under which deductions are granted for home loan borrowers. And the three most important sections are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Section 24(b)</strong></li><li><strong>Section 80EE</strong></li><li><strong>Section 80EEA</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Section 24 (b) allows us to claim a deduction of up to Rs.2 Lakhs on the interest component, and under section 80C, one can claim a deduction of up to Rs.1.5 lakhs on the principal component.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">These have been there for some time now. Two new sections called Section 80EE and <strong>Section 80EEA,</strong>&nbsp;have been introduced through which a person with a home loan can enjoy additional benefits.&nbsp;<strong>Section 80EEA&nbsp;</strong>benefits First Time <strong>Home Buyer</strong>. These First Time <strong>Home Buyer Tax Benefits</strong> can be claimed if a borrower meets certain eligibility criteria. The details regarding the eligibility criteria are also discussed in this article.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-section-80eea-and-who-this-is-for\"><strong>Section 80EEA and who this is for?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">If a person buys a property using a home loan, they can enjoy some additional deductions on the income tax, provided he is a first-time homebuyer. Under Income Tax Act, 1961, some provisions were made to help people buy houses at affordable prices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-when-was-section-80eea-introduced\"><strong>When was Section 80EEA introduced?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Of the many programs launched by the Narendra Modi government when it first came into power in 2014, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana or PMAY was launched to encourage home buyers. The centre has decided to offer subsidies to advance this cause. To upgrade this scheme, several measures, such as the introduction of&nbsp;<strong>Section 80EEA</strong>, were taken. This was introduced in 2019.Thanks to&nbsp;<strong>Section 80EEA</strong>, any home loans taken during the period between April 1, 2019, and March 31, 2021 (which was later extended until March 31, 2022) are eligible for us to claim interest deductions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-definition-section-80eea-of-the-income-tax-act\"><strong>Definition: Section 80EEA of the Income Tax Act:</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The term Section 80EEA was first coined by Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. This was a part of Union Budget 2019 to further promote the dream of &#8220;Housing for All by 2022&#8221; with one chief motive, providing tax benefits so that people can buy houses at economical rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-deduction-amount-under-section-80eea\"><strong>Deduction amount under Section 80EEA</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Before introducing <strong>Section 80EEA,&nbsp;</strong>people were able to save an amount of Rs 2 lakhs under Section 24(b). With <strong>Section 80EEA</strong> in effect, people can save an additional Rs 1.5 lakhs per year on the interest while paying the home loan in instalments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Here is the gist of Nirmala Sitharaman&#8217;s statement regarding housing loans during the budget speech in 2019 :</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">An interest reduction of up to Rs 2 Lakhs can be claimed. An additional deduction of Rs 1.5 lakhs will be allowed for interest paid on loans taken before or up to March 31, 2020, for a house valuing Rs 45 lakhs. Hence, a home buyer can now enjoy an interest deduction of up to Rs 3.5 lakhs. This was extended for another year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-meaning-of-affordable-housing\"><strong>Meaning of affordable housing</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Before&nbsp;<strong>Section 80EEA</strong> was introduced, properties valued up to Rs 50 lakhs fell under the category of &#8216;affordable homes.&#8217; Post inclusion of Section 80EEA in the income tax law, properties priced up to Rs 45 lakhs fall under &#8216;affordable homes&#8217; since September 1, 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-eligibility-criteria-to-avail-of-these-benefits-tax-benefit-for-first-home-purchase\"><strong>Eligibility criteria to avail of these benefits(Tax Benefit For First Home Purchase)</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Here are the details about who may claim these benefits under Section 80EEA.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>These deductions are on home loan interest only.</li><li>The person should be a first-time homebuyer to reap the benefits under Section 80EEA. The clause specifies that to avail of these benefits, the home loan borrower shouldn&#8217;t have any previous properties.</li><li>The maximum deduction one can claim Rs 1.50 lakhs per year.</li><li>This home loan interest deduction is only for the home loans granted between April 1, 2019, and March 31, 2022.</li><li>Only individuals with a housing loan are allowed to enjoy these benefits. This scheme is exclusively for the individuals who have taken home loans and any other taxpayer such as Hindu Undivided Families or HUF, Partnership firm, a company, AOP, is not allowed any benefits that come as a part of the scheme.</li><li>To claim these benefits, the home loan should be borrowed from a financial institution, i.e. banks, housing finance companies, and the deductions do not apply to the home loans borrowed from relatives, family members, or friends.</li><li>The deductions apply to the properties valued up to Rs 45 Lakhs and not to the properties exceeding this limit.</li><li>It is crucial to note that these benefits can only be claimed if the loans are used to buy the properties and cannot be claimed if used for reconstruction, maintenance, or any other repairs, etc.</li><li>Only a home loan buyer not claiming any benefits under Section 80EE can claim the deductions under <strong>Section 80EEA.</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-are-nris-eligible-for-the-deductions-under-section-80eea\"><strong>Are NRIs eligible for the deductions under Section 80EEA?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The law doesn&#8217;t specifically mention any restriction that the first-time buyer should only be an Indian resident to avail of these benefits. So it is inferred that even Non-resident Indians can claim the benefits under Section 80EEA.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-terms-and-conditions-to-claim-benefits-under-section-80eea\"><strong>Terms and conditions to claim benefits under Section 80EEA</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The law states that these benefits apply to properties with sizes up to 645 sq ft or 60 sq meters if located in metropolitan cities. The size should not exceed 968 sq ft or 90 sq meters if the unit is located in any other city.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-which-cities-come-under-the-category-of-metropolitan-cities-under-section-80eea\"><strong>Which cities come under the category of metropolitan cities under Section 80EEA?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the cities that fall under the category of metropolitan cities</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Bangalore</li><li>Delhi</li><li>Chennai</li><li>Faridabad</li><li>Hyderabad</li><li>Kolkata</li><li>Mumbai</li><li>Noida</li><li>Gurugram</li><li>Greater Noida</li><li>Ghaziabad</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-if-the-unit-is-not-self-occupied-can-a-person-still-claim-the-benefits-under-section-80eea\"><strong>What if the unit is not self-occupied? Can a person still claim the benefits under Section 80EEA?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The law does not mention any such specification. Therefore, the buyers living in rented units can claim these deductions. In addition to these, they can also claim HRA benefits which come as a part of Section 80GG.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-few-differences-between-section-80eea-and-section-24-b\"><strong>Few differences between Section 80EEA and Section 24(b)</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Home loan buyers can claim the benefits of Section 24(b) as well as Section 80EEA. This increases their non-taxable income up to Rs 3.50 lakhs, provided all other eligibility criteria are met.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Possession of the property is mandatory to claim the benefits under Section 24(b). It is not required for you to possess the property to claim the deductions for the interest on a home loan. You can claim the deductions immediately as you start paying the interest.</li><li>Under Section 24(b), deductions can be claimed for any loans borrowed from financial institutions or personal sources. But benefits under Section 80EEA apply to the loans borrowed from banks.</li><li>The maximum deduction one can get under Section 24 (b) is Rs.2 lakhs if the owner lives in the property. This also applies if the house is vacant. The whole interest is allowed as a deduction if the property is rented out. Under Section 80EEA, the maximum deduction limit is Rs 1.50 lakhs.</li><li>While the property value must not exceed Rs 45 lakhs to avail of the benefits under Section 80EEA, there is no property value specification to claim benefits under Section 24(b).</li><li>Any loans granted after April 1, 1999, are eligible for deductions under Section 24(b). Loans sanctioned between April 1, 2019, and March 31, 2021, are eligible for deduction benefits under Section 80EEA.</li><li>All home loan buyers (even if they already own a property) are entitled to the benefits under Section 24(b). Only the first-time individuals(home buyers) are allowed to claim deductions under Section 80EEA.</li><li>It is vital to understand Section 80C according to which to claim these benefits; the individuals should not sell the property in 5 years.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-understanding-the-differences-between-section-80eea-and-section-80ee\"><strong>Understanding the differences between Section 80EEA and Section 80EE</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The buyers demanding benefits under Section 80EE are not allowed to claim benefits under Section 80EEA according to income tax law.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The deductions under Section 80EE can be claimed on properties worth up to Rs 50 lakhs. The benefits under Section 80EEA can be claimed on properties valued up to Rs. 45 lakhs.</li><li>The loan amount specification to claim the benefits of Section 80EE is up to Rs 35 Lakhs, and this specification is not specified in Section 80EEA.</li><li>The home loans taken between April 1, 2016, and March 31, 2017, are eligible to claim the benefits of Section 80EE. The loan period in the case of Section 80EEA is between April 1, 2019, and March 31, 2021.</li><li>A maximum rebate of Rs 50000 is allowed under Section 80EE while it amounts to Rs 1.5 lakhs in the case of Section 80EEA.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-does-section-80-eea-apply-to-loans-bought-in-2016\"><strong>Does Section 80 EEA apply to loans bought in 2016?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The answer is no. The law specifically states that this is applicable only on the loans sanctioned between April 1, 2019, and March 31, 2021. And the deductions under Section 80EEA do not apply to loans granted before or after this period.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-conclusion\"><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">To encourage the people of India to have their own houses, the government of India, with an objective of housing for all, extended its support by introducing section 80 EEA. It is an extension of section 80EE under which a deduction of up to Rs.50000 is allowed on the loans sanctioned between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2017 for first-time home buyers. The benefit has been extended by the government for FY 2019-20. You can now claim the deduction until the housing loan is paid off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Under Section 80EE, the interest deduction can be claimed if a house loan is taken in AY 2020-21 or FY 2019-20.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The government takes these steps to uplift the real-estate sector in the small housing category.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-you-might-also-like\">You Might Also Like</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-yoast-seo-related-links\"><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/tax-benefits-for-first-time-homebuyers-under-section-80eea\">Tax Benefits for First-time Homebuyers Under Section 80EEA</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/simple-ways-for-nri-to-sell-property-in-india\">Simple ways for NRI to sell property in India</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/tax-on-rental-income\">Tax on Rental Income and the Applicable Deductions</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/income-tax-benefit-on-home-loan-what-you-should-know\">Income tax benefit on home loan- What you should know</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/epfo-claim-process-2020-after-covid-19\">EPFO Claim Process 2020 after COVID 19</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-frequently-asked-questions-faq-s\">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ&#8217;s)</h2>\n\n\n        <section class=\"sc_fs_faq sc_card\">\n            <div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>1.\tIs there any benefit that a home buyer can claim on the principal component of the home loan?</h2>                <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYes, under Section 80C, a buyer can claim up to Rs 1.5 lakh deduction on the principal portion.                    </p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </section>\n\t        <section class=\"sc_fs_faq sc_card\">\n            <div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>2.\tCan I claim the benefits under both Section 24 and Section 80EEA?</h2>                <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYes.

            "content_text": "We all know that a home loan comprises two components- Interest and Principal.\n\n\n\nThere are different sections in the tax law under which deductions are granted for home loan borrowers. And the three most important sections are:\n\n\n\nSection 24(b)Section 80EESection 80EEA\n\n\n\nSection 24 (b) allows us to claim a deduction of up to Rs.2 Lakhs on the interest component, and under section 80C, one can claim a deduction of up to Rs.1.5 lakhs on the principal component.\n\n\n\nThese have been there for some time now. Two new sections called Section 80EE and Section 80EEA,&nbsp;have been introduced through which a person with a home loan can enjoy additional benefits.&nbsp;Section 80EEA&nbsp;benefits First Time Home Buyer. These First Time Home Buyer Tax Benefits can be claimed if a borrower meets certain eligibility criteria. The details regarding the eligibility criteria are also discussed in this article.\n\n\n\nSection 80EEA and who this is for?\n\n\n\nIf a person buys a property using a home loan, they can enjoy some additional deductions on the income tax, provided he is a first-time homebuyer. Under Income Tax Act, 1961, some provisions were made to help people buy houses at affordable prices.\n\n\n\nWhen was Section 80EEA introduced?\n\n\n\nOf the many programs launched by the Narendra Modi government when it first came into power in 2014, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana or PMAY was launched to encourage home buyers. The centre has decided to offer subsidies to advance this cause. To upgrade this scheme, several measures, such as the introduction of&nbsp;Section 80EEA, were taken. This was introduced in 2019.Thanks to&nbsp;Section 80EEA, any home loans taken during the period between April 1, 2019, and March 31, 2021 (which was later extended until March 31, 2022) are eligible for us to claim interest deductions.\n\n\n\nDefinition: Section 80EEA of the Income Tax Act:\n\n\n\nThe term Section 80EEA was first coined by Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. This was a part of Union Budget 2019 to further promote the dream of &#8220;Housing for All by 2022&#8221; with one chief motive, providing tax benefits so that people can buy houses at economical rates.\n\n\n\nDeduction amount under Section 80EEA\n\n\n\nBefore introducing Section 80EEA,&nbsp;people were able to save an amount of Rs 2 lakhs under Section 24(b). With Section 80EEA in effect, people can save an additional Rs 1.5 lakhs per year on the interest while paying the home loan in instalments.\n\n\n\nHere is the gist of Nirmala Sitharaman&#8217;s statement regarding housing loans during the budget speech in 2019 :\n\n\n\nAn interest reduction of up to Rs 2 Lakhs can be claimed. An additional deduction of Rs 1.5 lakhs will be allowed for interest paid on loans taken before or up to March 31, 2020, for a house valuing Rs 45 lakhs. Hence, a home buyer can now enjoy an interest deduction of up to Rs 3.5 lakhs. This was extended for another year.\n\n\n\nMeaning of affordable housing\n\n\n\nBefore&nbsp;Section 80EEA was introduced, properties valued up to Rs 50 lakhs fell under the category of &#8216;affordable homes.&#8217; Post inclusion of Section 80EEA in the income tax law, properties priced up to Rs 45 lakhs fall under &#8216;affordable homes&#8217; since September 1, 2019.\n\n\n\nEligibility criteria to avail of these benefits(Tax Benefit For First Home Purchase)\n\n\n\nHere are the details about who may claim these benefits under Section 80EEA.\n\n\n\nThese deductions are on home loan interest only.The person should be a first-time homebuyer to reap the benefits under Section 80EEA. The clause specifies that to avail of these benefits, the home loan borrower shouldn&#8217;t have any previous properties.The maximum deduction one can claim Rs 1.50 lakhs per year.This home loan interest deduction is only for the home loans granted between April 1, 2019, and March 31, 2022.Only individuals with a housing loan are allowed to enjoy these benefits. This scheme is exclusively for the individuals who have taken home loans and any other taxpayer such as Hindu Undivided Families or HUF, Partnership firm, a company, AOP, is not allowed any benefits that come as a part of the scheme.To claim these benefits, the home loan should be borrowed from a financial institution, i.e. banks, housing finance companies, and the deductions do not apply to the home loans borrowed from relatives, family members, or friends.The deductions apply to the properties valued up to Rs 45 Lakhs and not to the properties exceeding this limit.It is crucial to note that these benefits can only be claimed if the loans are used to buy the properties and cannot be claimed if used for reconstruction, maintenance, or any other repairs, etc.Only a home loan buyer not claiming any benefits under Section 80EE can claim the deductions under Section 80EEA.\n\n\n\nAre NRIs eligible for the deductions under Section 80EEA?\n\n\n\nThe law doesn&#8217;t specifically mention any restriction that the first-time buyer should only be an Indian resident to avail of these benefits. So it is inferred that even Non-resident Indians can claim the benefits under Section 80EEA.\n\n\n\nTerms and conditions to claim benefits under Section 80EEA\n\n\n\nThe law states that these benefits apply to properties with sizes up to 645 sq ft or 60 sq meters if located in metropolitan cities. The size should not exceed 968 sq ft or 90 sq meters if the unit is located in any other city.\n\n\n\nWhich cities come under the category of metropolitan cities under Section 80EEA?\n\n\n\nThese are the cities that fall under the category of metropolitan cities\n\n\n\nBangaloreDelhiChennaiFaridabadHyderabadKolkataMumbaiNoidaGurugramGreater NoidaGhaziabad\n\n\n\nWhat if the unit is not self-occupied? Can a person still claim the benefits under Section 80EEA?\n\n\n\nThe law does not mention any such specification. Therefore, the buyers living in rented units can claim these deductions. In addition to these, they can also claim HRA benefits which come as a part of Section 80GG.\n\n\n\nFew differences between Section 80EEA and Section 24(b)\n\n\n\nHome loan buyers can claim the benefits of Section 24(b) as well as Section 80EEA. This increases their non-taxable income up to Rs 3.50 lakhs, provided all other eligibility criteria are met.\n\n\n\nPossession of the property is mandatory to claim the benefits under Section 24(b). It is not required for you to possess the property to claim the deductions for the interest on a home loan. You can claim the deductions immediately as you start paying the interest.Under Section 24(b), deductions can be claimed for any loans borrowed from financial institutions or personal sources. But benefits under Section 80EEA apply to the loans borrowed from banks.The maximum deduction one can get under Section 24 (b) is Rs.2 lakhs if the owner lives in the property. This also applies if the house is vacant. The whole interest is allowed as a deduction if the property is rented out. Under Section 80EEA, the maximum deduction limit is Rs 1.50 lakhs.While the property value must not exceed Rs 45 lakhs to avail of the benefits under Section 80EEA, there is no property value specification to claim benefits under Section 24(b).Any loans granted after April 1, 1999, are eligible for deductions under Section 24(b). Loans sanctioned between April 1, 2019, and March 31, 2021, are eligible for deduction benefits under Section 80EEA.All home loan buyers (even if they already own a property) are entitled to the benefits under Section 24(b). Only the first-time individuals(home buyers) are allowed to claim deductions under Section 80EEA.It is vital to understand Section 80C according to which to claim these benefits; the individuals should not sell the property in 5 years.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the differences between Section 80EEA and Section 80EE\n\n\n\nThe buyers demanding benefits under Section 80EE are not allowed to claim benefits under Section 80EEA according to income tax law.\n\n\n\nThe deductions under Section 80EE can be claimed on properties worth up to Rs 50 lakhs. The benefits under Section 80EEA can be claimed on properties valued up to Rs. 45 lakhs.The loan amount specification to claim the benefits of Section 80EE is up to Rs 35 Lakhs, and this specification is not specified in Section 80EEA.The home loans taken between April 1, 2016, and March 31, 2017, are eligible to claim the benefits of Section 80EE. The loan period in the case of Section 80EEA is between April 1, 2019, and March 31, 2021.A maximum rebate of Rs 50000 is allowed under Section 80EE while it amounts to Rs 1.5 lakhs in the case of Section 80EEA.\n\n\n\nDoes Section 80 EEA apply to loans bought in 2016?\n\n\n\nThe answer is no. The law specifically states that this is applicable only on the loans sanctioned between April 1, 2019, and March 31, 2021. And the deductions under Section 80EEA do not apply to loans granted before or after this period.\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\n\n\nTo encourage the people of India to have their own houses, the government of India, with an objective of housing for all, extended its support by introducing section 80 EEA. It is an extension of section 80EE under which a deduction of up to Rs.50000 is allowed on the loans sanctioned between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2017 for first-time home buyers. The benefit has been extended by the government for FY 2019-20. You can now claim the deduction until the housing loan is paid off.\n\n\n\nUnder Section 80EE, the interest deduction can be claimed if a house loan is taken in AY 2020-21 or FY 2019-20.\n\n\n\nThe government takes these steps to uplift the real-estate sector in the small housing category.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\nTax Benefits for First-time Homebuyers Under Section 80EEASimple ways for NRI to sell property in IndiaTax on Rental Income and the Applicable DeductionsIncome tax benefit on home loan- What you should knowEPFO Claim Process 2020 after COVID 19\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ&#8217;s)\n\n\n        \n            \n\t\t\t\t1.\tIs there any benefit that a home buyer can claim on the principal component of the home loan?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tYes, under Section 80C, a buyer can claim up to Rs 1.5 lakh deduction on the principal portion.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\t2.\tCan I claim the benefits under both Section 24 and Section 80EEA?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tYes.

            "content_html": "\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">In an age where digital libraries are quickly replacing good old book libraries, the National Library In Kolkata not only stands its ground as one of the biggest mammoths in the country but also challenges modern reading methods by offering that one intangible emotion no digital reproduction can ever provide for: The scent of printed media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The National Library is a bibliophile mecca. The fact that the building itself is a palace that dates its origins to the 18<sup>th</sup> century AD, adds to its pomp.\u00a0 Spread across a whopping 65000 odd Sq. Ft area, the pristine white structure National library is a crucial part of the swanky Belvedere estate (which, in itself, claims 30 acres) situated in Alipore, Kolkata.\u00a0 What is already an affluent residential hub also has the Belvedere estate and the National Library to brag about.<br><br>The immense white building is very reminiscent of British architectural influence in India. And what better place for the National Library of India to call home? Bengal, in general, has always displayed a high affinity towards education, clocking in at an average literacy rate of 80%, with Kolkata ranking 2<sup>nd</sup> in the state, with an 87.14% literacy rate.<br><br>Bengal has produced some of the most proficient and educated leaders of India, including greats like Rabindranath Tagore, Sri Aurobindo, Mahasweta Devi, Satyajit Ray, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, and Rajshekhar Basu, to name a few.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-history-and-preludes-of-national-library\"><strong>History and preludes of National Library</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The National Library of Kolkata is the largest library in the country in terms of the sheer volume of books and public records stored. And because it falls directly under the purview of the Ministry of Culture, the library has much to show for the centuries gone by. Resulting from the conglomeration of the Public Library of Kolkata (Originally called Calcutta Public Library) and the Imperial Library (A British venture), the National Library is one of the four libraries in India authorized to receive a printed copy of every book/publication ever published anywhere pan India. The National Library Kolkata was officially named so post-independence in 1948 under the Change of Name Act and was made available to the public in 1953 by the then Minister of Education, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">What is also a \u201crecommended\u201d moment here is the fact that the original Public Library of Calcutta was an initiative undertaken by Lord Curzon in an attempt to provide for a free library that would be available to the Public with no strings attached. This was supported by the Library of Congress and the National Library would soon receive close to 2000 volumes offloaded by the Library of Congress. In 3 decades, the National Library would go on to become one of India\u2019s biggest libraries, housing close to 4 lakh volumes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">As such, the original storing location of these manuscripts and books was the Esplanade, a splendid area designated by Sir Warren Hastings as the venue for elegant \u201cwalking\u201d parties. The Esplanade is also famed for hosting the first-ever recorded football match between the Calcutta Club of Civilians and the Gentlemen of Barrackpore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">However, as the Imperial Library was disbanded and the name was officially changed to The National Library, all these books were transferred to the present location of Belvedere Estate, Alipore. This would also be renamed once and for all in 1976, going from National Library to the National Library of India.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-mystery-chronicles-of-national-library-kolkata\"><br><strong>The Mystery Chronicles of National Library Kolkata</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The National Library is an intriguing place with a lot of history associated with the actual building that the library calls home now.\u00a0 A large chunk of information, that was previously elusive, has been uncovered in recent years. Some of these include:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">1. ASI (The Archaeological Survey of India) had a vested interest in a hidden chamber that was discovered in 2010, roughly 6 decades after the library was even opened to the public. And because no trapdoor or escape door was found, a lot of rumors floated around for quite some time, including the ones that said it was a torture chamber used by General Hastings, to speculations about this chamber being used as a treasure vault. These rumors were, however, dismissed a year later as the chamber was full of sand, and was assumed it was only to provide structural integrity to the seemingly old building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">2. The library was started off as an NGO/Free for all library. This tradition is upheld to this day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">3. As of today, the national library holds more than 2.2 million books, making it India\u2019s largest library.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">4. The absolute first donations in terms of books and publications came from Fort William as a gesture of goodwill.

            "content_text": "In an age where digital libraries are quickly replacing good old book libraries, the National Library In Kolkata not only stands its ground as one of the biggest mammoths in the country but also challenges modern reading methods by offering that one intangible emotion no digital reproduction can ever provide for: The scent of printed media.\n\n\n\nThe National Library is a bibliophile mecca. The fact that the building itself is a palace that dates its origins to the 18th century AD, adds to its pomp.\u00a0 Spread across a whopping 65000 odd Sq. Ft area, the pristine white structure National library is a crucial part of the swanky Belvedere estate (which, in itself, claims 30 acres) situated in Alipore, Kolkata.\u00a0 What is already an affluent residential hub also has the Belvedere estate and the National Library to brag about.The immense white building is very reminiscent of British architectural influence in India. And what better place for the National Library of India to call home? Bengal, in general, has always displayed a high affinity towards education, clocking in at an average literacy rate of 80%, with Kolkata ranking 2nd in the state, with an 87.14% literacy rate.Bengal has produced some of the most proficient and educated leaders of India, including greats like Rabindranath Tagore, Sri Aurobindo, Mahasweta Devi, Satyajit Ray, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, and Rajshekhar Basu, to name a few.\n\n\n\nHistory and preludes of National Library\n\n\n\nThe National Library of Kolkata is the largest library in the country in terms of the sheer volume of books and public records stored. And because it falls directly under the purview of the Ministry of Culture, the library has much to show for the centuries gone by. Resulting from the conglomeration of the Public Library of Kolkata (Originally called Calcutta Public Library) and the Imperial Library (A British venture), the National Library is one of the four libraries in India authorized to receive a printed copy of every book/publication ever published anywhere pan India. The National Library Kolkata was officially named so post-independence in 1948 under the Change of Name Act and was made available to the public in 1953 by the then Minister of Education, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad.\n\n\n\nWhat is also a \u201crecommended\u201d moment here is the fact that the original Public Library of Calcutta was an initiative undertaken by Lord Curzon in an attempt to provide for a free library that would be available to the Public with no strings attached. This was supported by the Library of Congress and the National Library would soon receive close to 2000 volumes offloaded by the Library of Congress. In 3 decades, the National Library would go on to become one of India\u2019s biggest libraries, housing close to 4 lakh volumes.\n\n\n\nAs such, the original storing location of these manuscripts and books was the Esplanade, a splendid area designated by Sir Warren Hastings as the venue for elegant \u201cwalking\u201d parties. The Esplanade is also famed for hosting the first-ever recorded football match between the Calcutta Club of Civilians and the Gentlemen of Barrackpore.\n\n\n\nHowever, as the Imperial Library was disbanded and the name was officially changed to The National Library, all these books were transferred to the present location of Belvedere Estate, Alipore. This would also be renamed once and for all in 1976, going from National Library to the National Library of India.\n\n\n\nThe Mystery Chronicles of National Library Kolkata\n\n\n\nThe National Library is an intriguing place with a lot of history associated with the actual building that the library calls home now.\u00a0 A large chunk of information, that was previously elusive, has been uncovered in recent years. Some of these include:\n\n\n\n1. ASI (The Archaeological Survey of India) had a vested interest in a hidden chamber that was discovered in 2010, roughly 6 decades after the library was even opened to the public. And because no trapdoor or escape door was found, a lot of rumors floated around for quite some time, including the ones that said it was a torture chamber used by General Hastings, to speculations about this chamber being used as a treasure vault. These rumors were, however, dismissed a year later as the chamber was full of sand, and was assumed it was only to provide structural integrity to the seemingly old building.\n\n\n\n2. The library was started off as an NGO/Free for all library. This tradition is upheld to this day.\n\n\n\n3. As of today, the national library holds more than 2.2 million books, making it India\u2019s largest library.\n\n\n\n4. The absolute first donations in terms of books and publications came from Fort William as a gesture of goodwill. These contained precious manuscripts, maps, and first editions.\n\n\n\nThe library served as the Governor-General\u2019s residence pre-Independence, adding to its rich heritage.\n\n\n\nPresent Day Services: National Library of India\n\n\n\nThe National Library is still in service, catering to the needs of hundreds of thousands of bibliophiles and ardent readers. Some of the modern-day services the National Library of India offers are:\n\n\n\nBooks are lent out against a nominal security deposit.A microfilm lab is offered as a lucrative reading facility that offers content ranging from rare footage to rare manuscripts.Photocopy sections allow readers to take a piece of their favorite works back home in the form of Xerox copies.Training and consultancy services are also provided in the National Library, a service that is seldom seen in other libraries.The library is open round the year except for national holidays namely Republic day, Independence Day, and Gandhi Jayanti.A vast e-directory for quick reference links to the content a potential reader might be looking for.\n\n\n\nE-resources offered\n\n\n\nWith changing times, the National Library has also adapted to modern methods to cater to the needs of everyone irrespective of age. Some of these resources include:\n\n\n\nA whopping 25000 digitized books and documents.A mammoth collection of early English books under the moniker Early English Books Online (EEBO) that houses a collection of books published between the late 1400s to the early 1700s.A monstrous collection of close to 28 lakh dissertations from over 700 academic institutions from around the world.7000 research journals from all disciplines are added to the database each year.\n\n\n\nSightseeing and Tourism\n\n\n\nApart from being the largest library in the country, the National Library of India also houses every book published in the country, hence acting as a legal deposit library of India.The National Library is also flanked by high-rise hotels and restaurants and other sight-seeing haunts.\n\n\n\nSonargaonChinoiserieCAL-27Bhawanipore cemeteryVictoria memorial hallSt. Paul\u2019s cathedral.\n\n\n\nMain building and membership of National Library\n\n\n\nThe reading halls, in themselves, can house over 500 people, which gives you a rough idea of how huge the library is.&nbsp; It also shares premises with the absolutely breath-taking tajbengal hotel and zoological garden.&nbsp; The library itself houses a small museum, offers an exhibition show that displays the history of India in symbols, and another one that presents the stories of freedom fighters hailing from Bengal, which is nothing short of international quality.\n\n\n\nThe rarest of manuscripts are kept in an airtight vault to ensure longevity and quality preservation of the metaphorical \u201cpages of history\u201d, only here, the age-old saying is quite literal. The National Library also houses an art gallery, which, at first glance, might not be advertised.\n\n\n\nThe National Library requires quite a bit of paperwork to be filled in before you even begin to start talking about books. Entry into the Library requires a membership.&nbsp; If you are a tourist, and are there for just a day or two and do not see it wise to avail the membership, you will have to go through strict security measures and protocols, fill out a form, await approval, and then you can go take a peep at the actual Belvedere Hall or take a stroll in the lush green rolling lawns. Once inside, photography is strictly prohibited, and absolute silence is advocated, which makes this place something tourists should be very thoughtful of while drafting their travel plans.However, the library is open in a very convenient window of time, starting at 9 A.M. every day to 8 P.M. However, reader\u2019s passes are only issued from 11 A.M to 1 P.M and again from 3 P.M. to 4 P.M.\n\n\n\nProperty pricing\n\n\n\nAlipore, as an area in general, is extremely high-rise and posh. Most of Kolkata\u2019s politicians reside in Alipore, which makes the property prices in this area utopian. Owing to its rich heritage, history, and the fact that Alipore has witnessed a lot of British activity, Alipore ranks up there in terms of socio-economic value.

In short, if one wishes to buy the National Library of India on the whole, we are looking at a price tag ranging anywhere between 125 crores to 127 crores, and this is excluding the fact that it is tagged by the ASI as a cultural heritage site of utmost historical importance.\n\n\n\nThe scope of growth is limited as the Belvedere Estate, the Esplanade, and the neighbouring areas are listed as areas of cultural and historical importance, which means apart from routine maintenance jobs, the possibility of a complex, or a society, is near impossible. Bungalows are an exception.Although access to the actual Belvedere Estate is limited, Alipore\u2019s connectivity is unparalleled, as it sits at the very heart of Kolkata, with broad roads leading out to virtually every corner of the city. The area is also power-packed with 5-star hotels, high-quality restaurants, eateries, and enough sightseeing spots to keep a potential tourist on his/her toes the whole day.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\nKolkata realty market to get major boost from Alipore Jail shiftShifting of the Alipore Jail to boost real estate market in prime neighborhoodReal estate developers go digital; buck the lockdown with stupendous bookingsKolkata real estate market to get another massive boost after Alipore Jail shiftNational Capital Region: The Right Place to Invest in 2018\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ&#8217;s)\n\n\n        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhere is the National Library of India located?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe National Library of India is situated in the sprawling Belvedere Estate of Alipore, Kolkata.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tIs the National Library of India a new library?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tNo. The library was formed when the Public Library of Calcutta and the Imperial Library formed a conglomeration.

The National Library received close to 7000 research papers and journals from major educational establishments.c. The National Library is one of the four libraries in India designated for the collection, storing and dissemination of documents/books/manuscripts in India.d. The National Library is probably one of the oldest libraries in the country that is still in service, and a lot of its first bookkeeping entries come from offloads from the then Governor General of India. This offload included rare manuscripts, first editions, and publications that one cannot find now.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t\nThe post National Library Kolkata: A Monolith Amidst Digital Horizons appeared first on Real Estate News.",

We are aware that the area of the land remains constant, but the population keeps growing, and hence for the government to manage both infrastructure needs and provide rehabilitation to landowners who lose their land because of it.

Over the years, a lot of amendments have been made for this activity, such as Land Acquisition Act 1894 and 2013, Land Acquisition Act 2015, Land Acquisition Act 2020, Railway Land Acquisition Act 2016 to protect and give fair compensation and rehabilitation to the landowners who sacrifice their lands for infrastructure projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-definition-of-land-acquisition-act\"><strong>Definition of</strong> <strong>Land Acquisition Act</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, in short, known as Land Acquisition Act. &nbsp;It was passed by the Indian Parliament to regulate the land acquisition and lay down rules and procedures for rehabilitation, compensation, and resettlement of citizens of India who lose their lands due to land acquisition. Some of the provisions like Section 30 of Land Acquisition Act stating \u2018Disputes as to apportionment\u2019 and Section 6 of Land Acquisition Act \u2018Declaration that land is required for a public purpose\u201d that will provide fair compensation to people who lose their lands due to land acquisition and also bring transparency in the process of land acquisition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Until 2013, Land Acquisition Act 1894 administered land acquisition in India, but on Dec 31, 2013, the President of India passed an ordinance with an official mandate to meet two objectives of farmer welfare and meeting the strategic and developmental needs of the country at double the current speed. Hence, Land Acquisition Act 1894 was replaced by Land Acquisition Act 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-a-brief-note-on-land-acquisition-act-2013\"><strong>A brief note on Land Acquisition Act, 2013</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Land Acquisition Act 1894,&nbsp;a 120-year-old act that was implemented during the&nbsp;British was replaced by&nbsp;the Land Acquisition Act 2013&nbsp;by the ordinance passed by the&nbsp;President of India. The difference between Land Acquisition Act 1894 And Land Acquisition Act 2013&nbsp;are:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">In the Land Acquisition Act of 1894, there was an absence of a united national law that addresses fair compensation when private land is acquired for government purposes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>There was no clear rule for fair rehabilitation of landowners and those directly affected by the loss of livelihoods for that particular land.&nbsp;</li><li>The rates paid for the lands acquired were as per government rates and not market rates which are unfair compensation to landowners who lose their lands.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">To fix all the above issues related to&nbsp;the Land Acquisition Act 1894, the president of India passed the Land Acquisition Act 2013&nbsp;on Dec 31, 2013, with fresh amendments applicable to all provinces throughout India.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-land-acquisition-act-2013-aims-and-objectives\"><strong>Land Acquisition Act 2013:</strong> <strong>Aims and Objectives</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The main aims and objectivesof theLand Acquisition Act 2013are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>To ensure a simple process for land acquisition, applied for industrialization, development of infrastructural facilities, and urbanization without causing any problems to the owners of the land and other affected families.</li><li>Provide fair and appreciable compensation based on the existing market rates. As per the Act, the compensation should be four times the market rate in rural areas and twice the market rate in urban areas.</li><li>To provide adequate rehabilitation and resettlement for the landowners and families who are directly affected by the loss of their land due to acquisition.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-land-acquisition-act-2013-is-applicable-when\"><strong>Land Acquisition Act 2013 is applicable when</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The state and the central government acquire private land for its use&nbsp;</li><li>The state and the central government acquire private land for public purposes like road construction, metro stations, bridges, and other infrastructure projects.</li><li>The State Government and Central government acquires private land but declares that land will be used by private firms for a public purpose. Here the term &#8216;public purpose&#8217; is clearly defined. Private companies can only use this acquired land for purposes like amusement parks, agriculture-related projects, industrial corridors, sports, healthcare, tourism, etc.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The scope of this act includes all land acquisition by the Central Government of India or any State Government of India, with the exception of the state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-different-provisions-and-purposes-of-the-land-acquisition-act-2013\"><strong>The different provisions and purposes of</strong> <strong>the Land Acquisition Act 2013</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">There are some provisions and purposes applicable to&nbsp;the Land Acquisition Act 2013concerning the land acquisition by the Central Government and State Government of India. The acquired lands can be used only for the following purposes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>For strategic purposes in relation to armed forces of the union, navy, or any work important to India&#8217;s defence and safety of the people under the strict watch of the State and the Central government of India.</li><li>For infrastructure projects for public use listed in the notification of the Department of Economic Affairs (Infrastructure section), excluding private educational institutions, private hospitals, and private hotels.</li><li>For agriculture-related projects like the supply of inputs to agriculture, cold storage facilities, agro-processing, marketing infrastructure for agriculture, and other related activities such as meat processing and dairy fisheries owned by government institutions.</li><li>For mining activities or industrial corridors, manufacturing zones, and national investment designated under the National Manufacturing Policy.</li><li>Projects for water harvesting, sanitation, and water conservation structures like dams.&nbsp;</li><li>Projects for Government aided education and research schemes</li><li>Projects for sport, tourism, health care, transportation, or space program under government administration</li><li>Projects for affected families who lose their land and livelihood due to land acquisition.</li><li>Project for providing housing for homeless, landless, and weaker sections of the society in rural and urban areas.</li><li>Project for residential development for people affected by natural calamities like floods and earthquakes.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-role-of-consent-under-the-land-acquisition-act-2013\"><strong>The role of Consent under the Land Acquisition Act 2013</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Before the land acquisition process, there are certain conditions undertheLand Acquisition Act 2013that have to be catered by the government, and one of them is obtaining the consent of landowners whose lands will be acquired for different purposes. The different rules of consent are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It is compulsory to get the consent of at least 70% of the landowners and the other affected families when the land is acquired for a project undertaken through a public and private partnership.</li><li>It is a must to obtain the consent of at least 80% of the landowners and the other affected families when the land is acquired for setting up private companies.</li><li>No consent is necessary for land acquisition from the landowners when the government acquires land for public purposes and controls the land bank directly.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">To make the process of taking consent from the landowners smoothly, the government has given the responsibility of obtaining consent through the district collector. The government has to maintain records of landowners, land rights, and the name of the occupants at all times. The district collector has to notify the Gram Sabha members three weeks before acquiring the consent.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-compensation-for-the-landowner-under-land-acquisition-act-2013\"><strong>Compensation for the landowner under Land Acquisition Act 2013</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Under section 26<strong>, </strong>the District Collector has the responsibility to determine the market value of the land acquired. The main criteria for determining the market value of the land are,</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The market value specified in the Indian Stamp Act 1899 for registration of sale deeds or agreements to sell the land</li><li>The average sale price of similar types of lands that are in the vicinity of the required land</li><li>The consented amount of compensation agreed in the case of land acquisitions for private companies or private-public partnerships projects.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The market value should be multiplied by a factor at least one or two times in the urban area and up to four times in rural areas. Under section 25 of the Act, the district collector has to make an award of compensation to landowners within 12 months from the publication of declaration and failing to which the entire land acquisition process will have lapsed. These 12 months can be extended under certain circumstances only under the approval of the state or central government. The collector will have to impose a \u2018solatium\u2019 which is the amount equivalent to 100% of the compensation under section 30 of the Land Acquisition Act.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-limitations-of-land-acquisition-act\"><strong>Limitations of Land Acquisition Act</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The NDA government made some amendments to&nbsp;the Land Acquisition Act 2013&nbsp;and formed the&nbsp;Land Acquisition Act 2015.&nbsp;Some of the shortcomings due to these changes are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The original Land Acquisition Act, 2013, came with a consent clause and the Social Impact Assessment for acquiring land for industrial corridors, Private- Public Partnership projects, affordable housing, rural infrastructure, and defence. But, after implementing the Act in 2015,&nbsp;all the above categories are exempted from Social Impact Assessment.</li><li>As consent and Social Impact Assessment are not mandatory for government projects, chances of forceful evictions of landowners with no proper rehabilitation and resettlement program is a high probability.&nbsp;</li><li>Earlier, multi-cropped land was not supposed to be acquired under&nbsp;Land Acquisition Act,but with the latest amendments, evenmulti-cropped land can be acquired for social infrastructure projects.&nbsp;</li><li>Earlier, the acquired land was returned to the farmer if it was not used for 5 years, but with the latest amendment, the acquired land will only be returned if the project doesn&#8217;t finish within the deadline.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-different-timelines-of-the-land-acquisition-act\"><strong>&nbsp;The different timelines of the Land Acquisition Act</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The different amendments made to<strong> Land Acquisition 1894 </strong>and the timelines are<strong>:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul type=\"1\"><li><strong>Land Acquisition Act 2011:</strong> This bill was introduced in Lok Sabha on September 7, 2011, and is known as \u2018Right to Fair Compensation, Resettlement, Rehabilitation and Transparency in Land Acquisition Bill\u2019. This was made to resolve the shortcomings of the Land Acquisition Act 1894. As per the bill, there will be a balance between facilitating land acquisition for public purposes and safeguarding farmers and landowners who lose their lands due to land acquisition.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Land Acquisition Act 2013</strong>: This act completely replaced LandAcquisition Act 1894 and is called the &#8220;Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation, and Resettlement Act.\u201d This bill was passed in Lok Sabha on August 29, 2013, and in Rajya Sabha on September 4, 2013. At that time, the president of India, Shri Pranab Mukherji, approved the bill on September 27, 2013. The act was implemented officially on 1 January 2014.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Land Acquisition Act 2015</strong>: The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation, and Resettlement. It was presented in the Lok Sabha on Feb 24, 2015, and passed by Lok Sabha on March 10, 2015. The President of India promulgates the amendment on May 30, 2015.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Conclusion</strong> Land is an essential resource for infrastructure development, which is needed for the country&#8217;s development. Land acquisition plays a major in infrastructure development as most of the lands are private and belong to individual owners. To safeguard and prevent forceful eviction and provide fair compensation, rehabilitation, and resettlement to the landowners and affected families from Land Acquisition Act ensures a smooth land acquisition and compensation distribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-you-might-also-like\">You Might Also Like</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-yoast-seo-related-links\"><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/huda-offers-double-market-price-acquire-land-master-roads-gurgaon\">Huda offers double the market price to acquire land for master roads in Gurgaon</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/everything-to-know-about-fair-value-of-land-before-purchasing-a-property-in-kerala\">Everything to Know About \u201cFair Value of Land\u201d Before Purchasing a Property in Kerala</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/telangana-real-estate-builders-asked-register-projects-rera\">Telangana real estate builders have been asked to register projects under RERA</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/rajasthan-land-pooling-schemes-act-2016\">Rajasthan Land Pooling Schemes Act, 2016</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/proptech-startup-square-yards-completes-acquisition-of-azuro\">Proptech Startup Square Yards completes acquisition of Azuro</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-frequently-asked-questions-faq-s\">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ&#8217;s)</h2>\n\n\n        <section class=\"sc_fs_faq sc_card\">\n            <div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>What is the significance of Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act?</h2>                <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnder section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, after the district collector takes order for acquisition, there should be a mandatory declaration that the land has been for public purpose.                    </p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </section>\n\t        <section class=\"sc_fs_faq sc_card\">\n            <div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Was there any Land Acquisition Act passed in 2020?</h2>                <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYes.

The difference between Land Acquisition Act 1894 And Land Acquisition Act 2013&nbsp;are:\n\n\n\nIn the Land Acquisition Act of 1894, there was an absence of a united national law that addresses fair compensation when private land is acquired for government purposes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere was no clear rule for fair rehabilitation of landowners and those directly affected by the loss of livelihoods for that particular land.&nbsp;The rates paid for the lands acquired were as per government rates and not market rates which are unfair compensation to landowners who lose their lands.\n\n\n\nTo fix all the above issues related to&nbsp;the Land Acquisition Act 1894, the president of India passed the Land Acquisition Act 2013&nbsp;on Dec 31, 2013, with fresh amendments applicable to all provinces throughout India.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLand Acquisition Act 2013: Aims and Objectives\n\n\n\nThe main aims and objectivesof theLand Acquisition Act 2013are:\n\n\n\nTo ensure a simple process for land acquisition, applied for industrialization, development of infrastructural facilities, and urbanization without causing any problems to the owners of the land and other affected families.Provide fair and appreciable compensation based on the existing market rates. As per the Act, the compensation should be four times the market rate in rural areas and twice the market rate in urban areas.To provide adequate rehabilitation and resettlement for the landowners and families who are directly affected by the loss of their land due to acquisition.\n\n\n\nLand Acquisition Act 2013 is applicable when\n\n\n\nThe state and the central government acquire private land for its use&nbsp;The state and the central government acquire private land for public purposes like road construction, metro stations, bridges, and other infrastructure projects.The State Government and Central government acquires private land but declares that land will be used by private firms for a public purpose. Here the term &#8216;public purpose&#8217; is clearly defined. Private companies can only use this acquired land for purposes like amusement parks, agriculture-related projects, industrial corridors, sports, healthcare, tourism, etc.\n\n\n\nThe scope of this act includes all land acquisition by the Central Government of India or any State Government of India, with the exception of the state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir.\n\n\n\nThe different provisions and purposes of the Land Acquisition Act 2013\n\n\n\nThere are some provisions and purposes applicable to&nbsp;the Land Acquisition Act 2013concerning the land acquisition by the Central Government and State Government of India. The acquired lands can be used only for the following purposes:\n\n\n\nFor strategic purposes in relation to armed forces of the union, navy, or any work important to India&#8217;s defence and safety of the people under the strict watch of the State and the Central government of India.For infrastructure projects for public use listed in the notification of the Department of Economic Affairs (Infrastructure section), excluding private educational institutions, private hospitals, and private hotels.For agriculture-related projects like the supply of inputs to agriculture, cold storage facilities, agro-processing, marketing infrastructure for agriculture, and other related activities such as meat processing and dairy fisheries owned by government institutions.For mining activities or industrial corridors, manufacturing zones, and national investment designated under the National Manufacturing Policy.Projects for water harvesting, sanitation, and water conservation structures like dams.&nbsp;Projects for Government aided education and research schemesProjects for sport, tourism, health care, transportation, or space program under government administrationProjects for affected families who lose their land and livelihood due to land acquisition.Project for providing housing for homeless, landless, and weaker sections of the society in rural and urban areas.Project for residential development for people affected by natural calamities like floods and earthquakes.\n\n\n\nThe role of Consent under the Land Acquisition Act 2013\n\n\n\nBefore the land acquisition process, there are certain conditions undertheLand Acquisition Act 2013that have to be catered by the government, and one of them is obtaining the consent of landowners whose lands will be acquired for different purposes. The different rules of consent are:\n\n\n\nIt is compulsory to get the consent of at least 70% of the landowners and the other affected families when the land is acquired for a project undertaken through a public and private partnership.It is a must to obtain the consent of at least 80% of the landowners and the other affected families when the land is acquired for setting up private companies.No consent is necessary for land acquisition from the landowners when the government acquires land for public purposes and controls the land bank directly.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo make the process of taking consent from the landowners smoothly, the government has given the responsibility of obtaining consent through the district collector. The government has to maintain records of landowners, land rights, and the name of the occupants at all times. The district collector has to notify the Gram Sabha members three weeks before acquiring the consent.\n\n\n\nCompensation for the landowner under Land Acquisition Act 2013\n\n\n\nUnder section 26, the District Collector has the responsibility to determine the market value of the land acquired. The main criteria for determining the market value of the land are,\n\n\n\nThe market value specified in the Indian Stamp Act 1899 for registration of sale deeds or agreements to sell the landThe average sale price of similar types of lands that are in the vicinity of the required landThe consented amount of compensation agreed in the case of land acquisitions for private companies or private-public partnerships projects.\n\n\n\nThe market value should be multiplied by a factor at least one or two times in the urban area and up to four times in rural areas. Under section 25 of the Act, the district collector has to make an award of compensation to landowners within 12 months from the publication of declaration and failing to which the entire land acquisition process will have lapsed. These 12 months can be extended under certain circumstances only under the approval of the state or central government. The collector will have to impose a \u2018solatium\u2019 which is the amount equivalent to 100% of the compensation under section 30 of the Land Acquisition Act.\n\n\n\nLimitations of Land Acquisition Act\n\n\n\nThe NDA government made some amendments to&nbsp;the Land Acquisition Act 2013&nbsp;and formed the&nbsp;Land Acquisition Act 2015.&nbsp;Some of the shortcomings due to these changes are:\n\n\n\nThe original Land Acquisition Act, 2013, came with a consent clause and the Social Impact Assessment for acquiring land for industrial corridors, Private- Public Partnership projects, affordable housing, rural infrastructure, and defence. But, after implementing the Act in 2015,&nbsp;all the above categories are exempted from Social Impact Assessment.As consent and Social Impact Assessment are not mandatory for government projects, chances of forceful evictions of landowners with no proper rehabilitation and resettlement program is a high probability.&nbsp;Earlier, multi-cropped land was not supposed to be acquired under&nbsp;Land Acquisition Act,but with the latest amendments, evenmulti-cropped land can be acquired for social infrastructure projects.&nbsp;Earlier, the acquired land was returned to the farmer if it was not used for 5 years, but with the latest amendment, the acquired land will only be returned if the project doesn&#8217;t finish within the deadline.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;The different timelines of the Land Acquisition Act\n\n\n\n&nbsp;The different amendments made to Land Acquisition 1894 and the timelines are:\n\n\n\nLand Acquisition Act 2011: This bill was introduced in Lok Sabha on September 7, 2011, and is known as \u2018Right to Fair Compensation, Resettlement, Rehabilitation and Transparency in Land Acquisition Bill\u2019. This was made to resolve the shortcomings of the Land Acquisition Act 1894. As per the bill, there will be a balance between facilitating land acquisition for public purposes and safeguarding farmers and landowners who lose their lands due to land acquisition.\n\n\n\nLand Acquisition Act 2013: This act completely replaced LandAcquisition Act 1894 and is called the &#8220;Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation, and Resettlement Act.\u201d This bill was passed in Lok Sabha on August 29, 2013, and in Rajya Sabha on September 4, 2013. At that time, the president of India, Shri Pranab Mukherji, approved the bill on September 27, 2013. The act was implemented officially on 1 January 2014.\n\n\n\nLand Acquisition Act 2015: The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation, and Resettlement. It was presented in the Lok Sabha on Feb 24, 2015, and passed by Lok Sabha on March 10, 2015. The President of India promulgates the amendment on May 30, 2015.\n\n\n\nConclusion Land is an essential resource for infrastructure development, which is needed for the country&#8217;s development. Land acquisition plays a major in infrastructure development as most of the lands are private and belong to individual owners. To safeguard and prevent forceful eviction and provide fair compensation, rehabilitation, and resettlement to the landowners and affected families from Land Acquisition Act ensures a smooth land acquisition and compensation distribution.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\nHuda offers double the market price to acquire land for master roads in GurgaonEverything to Know About \u201cFair Value of Land\u201d Before Purchasing a Property in KeralaTelangana real estate builders have been asked to register projects under RERARajasthan Land Pooling Schemes Act, 2016Proptech Startup Square Yards completes acquisition of Azuro\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ&#8217;s)\n\n\n        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhat is the significance of Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnder section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, after the district collector takes order for acquisition, there should be a mandatory declaration that the land has been for public purpose.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWas there any Land Acquisition Act passed in 2020?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tYes.

The Chennai corporation tax is levied by the Greater Chennai Corporation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">There are several rules and regulations regarding property tax. Payers need to be updated on the different rebates available and the method of calculating the tax to be paid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The Municipal Corporation of Chennai is the oldest municipal corporation to be formed in India back in 1688 on the basis of a 1607 charter by the East India Company. The corporation has increased from its earlier jurisdiction of a 10-mile radius from Fort St. George to now encompass the entire urban radius of Chennai. The size of the corporation has also grown from the 12 aldermen and 60 burgesses under founding Mayor Nathaniel Higginson to more than 250 officers including a Commissioner, Deputy Commissioners, Zonal Officers and Councillors. The corporation is now known as the Greater Chennai Corporation GCC.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The GCC consists of 200 councillors who report to the Mayor of Chennai. There is an executive wing of the Corporation which is headed by the commissioner. Under the commissioner, there are deputy commissioners and 15 zonal officers, one for each of the 15 zones that the 426 sq. km of the city of Chennai has been divided into.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-constitutes-residential-non-residential-property-in-chennai\"><strong>What constitutes residential, non-residential property in Chennai?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The classification of residential and non-residential property is very simple. A residential house or apartment which has not been rented or leased out and is being used solely for residential purposes is residential property.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Non-residential property constitutes shops, malls, movie halls, marriage halls, commercial spaces and plots even if they are not rented and being used by the owner.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-property-tax-rates-in-chennai\"><strong>Property tax rates in Chennai</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The rates of property taxes for residential property in Chennai vary from Re 0.6 to \u20b92.40 per sq. foot.

The zones from 1 to 15, in the same order, are Thiruvotriyur (Ward Nos 1 -14), Manali (Ward nos 15- 21), Madhavaram (Ward Nos. 22- 33, Tondiarpet (Ward nos. 34 \u2013 48), Royapuram (Ward nos. 49- 63), Thiruvikanagar (Ward nos. 64 \u2013 78), Ambattur (Ward nos. 79 \u2013 93), Anna Nagar (Ward nos. 94- 108), Tynampet (Ward nos. 109- 126), Kodambakkam (Ward nos. 127 -142), Valasaravakkam (ward nos. 143- 155), Alandur (Ward nos. 156- 167), Adyar (Ward nos. 170- 182), Perungudi (ward nos. 168, 169, 183-191) and the fifteenth zone Sholinganalur (ward nos. 192- 200).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-pay-property-tax-online-in-chennai\"><strong>Pay property tax online in Chennai</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">To pay property tax online in Chennai, a user needs to log in to the site https://chennaigovernemnt.gov.in\u00a0 and select the first option of \u2018property tax payment\u2019 in the online payments section.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">After clicking on the property tax icon, the next page that opens will ask for details of bill number, zone number and municipal ward number and a division code. A first-time payer will need to access previous bills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Once these requested details have been filled in, the amount that is to be paid will appear. The assessment period is to be filled in and the preferred mode of payment selected from the available options. An acknowledgement will be sent after successful payment. The portal allows a receipt of payment to be generated and printed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-offline-assessment-of-property-tax\"><strong>Offline Assessment of Property Tax</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">There is an option of choosing to pay the property tax offline. For this option, a filled application form is to be submitted along with receipts of previous taxes paid in any of the centres. The assessors shall submit their findings to the concerned officer and this will require further verification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The applicant shall receive a subsequent SMS on the registered mobile number after the committee clears the assessment for further action including payment of the proposed tax.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-guide-to-use-the-chennai-property-tax-calculator\"><strong>Guide to use the Chennai property tax calculator</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">There is an online property tax calculator installed in the GCC (Greater Chennai Corporation). This can be accessed by filling in the zone and ward numbers. Once these are entered, all the street names and numbers in the selected zone and ward open up in a drop-down menu. The street name is to be selected. After selection, the floor details are to be selected from another drop-down menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The data entry form asks for a separate selection of residential or non-residential status. In either selection, further details of the area under owner or tenant are to be filled in. if there is no tenant on the property, the tenant portion may be left blank. Once these are all filled in and the \u2018calculate demand\u2019 button clicked, the calculated value will be displayed. The system, however, warns that the calculated value is only a test value.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-another-way-to-calculate-property-tax-accurately-is-as-follows\"><strong>Another way to calculate property tax accurately is as follows:</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">An example is considered for 1500 Sq. Ft area and a rate of \u20b92 per sq. foot. The monthly rental works out to \u20b93000 per month and \u20b936000 for the entire year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The annual rental value is calculated by deducting 10% of the annual value. Thus, the annual rental value for the building is 36000-3600 = 32400.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Another 10% is deducted for the depreciation of the building. The calculation is 32400-3240 = Rs 29160</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">10% of the land value is now added. After adding the 10% of land value, the annual value for land and building becomes 29160+ 3600 which adds up to \u20b932760.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-method-of-fixing-an-annual-value-for-land-on-lease-or-rent-in-tamil-nadu\"><strong>Method of fixing an annual value for land on lease or Rent in Tamil Nadu</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">A plot of 2400 Sq. Ft is considered ground and is the basic unit for calculating tax. The rent per ground is \u20b98 per month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The annual value on 1 ground is 8 x 12 = 96.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The half-yearly property tax is calculated as a percentage of general tax and education tax minus a library cess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">For an annual value up to \u20b9500, the general tax is 3.75% and education tax is 2.5%. This adds up to a total half-yearly property tax of 6.25% from which a library cess of 0.37% is deducted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The rates of tax are 9.25% (6.75% general tax + 2.5% education tax) minus 0.67% library cess for annual values between \u20b9500 to \u20b91000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The calculated half-yearly property tax is 10.25% (7.75% general tax + 2.5% education tax) minus 0.67% library cess for annual values between \u20b91001 to \u20b95000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The rate of half yearly property tax is 11.25% (9% general tax + 2.5% education tax) minus 0.9% library cess for annual values above \u20b95000.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-concession-allowed-on-property-tax-in-chennai\"><strong>Concession allowed on property tax in Chennai.</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Depreciation of 1% is permitted for every building that is more than 4 years old.</li><li>A library cess of 10% of the general tax component is one of the permitted concessions.</li><li>There is an additional 20% rebate on the monthly rental value for the building roofing provided there is no terrace roofing.</li><li>There are rebates for self-owned property. For residential structures, the rebate for owner occupancy is 25% of the monthly rental value and 10% on non-residential structures.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-consequences-of-not-paying-the-property-tax-on-time\"><strong>Consequences of not paying the property tax on time</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">If property taxes are not paid within a grace period of 15 days, the GCC (Greater Chennai Corporation) charges a penalty at the rate of 2%. The cost of this penalty is automatically added to the assessment value for the next due payment of tax.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-getting-property-tax-payment-receipt-in-chennai\"><strong>Getting property tax payment receipt in Chennai</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The GCC website portal will need to be visited for accessing the payment receipt. In the online tax payment menu, there is a button for \u2018Online payment receipt\u2019. Once this option is selected, details such as the zone number, bill number, division code and sub number will need to be filled in.&nbsp; After filling in these details, the receipt will show up and can be accessed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-is-vacancy-remission\"><strong>What is vacancy Remission?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Vacancy Remission is the provision of providing a rebate on the property that has been lying vacant for at least 30 days during a half-yearly tax term. The GCC commissioner is allowed to allow a rebate of up to 50% as per section 105 of the Chennai City Municipality Corporation (CMCC) Act of 1919.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-to-register-your-complaints-against-officials\"><strong>How to register your complaints against officials?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The question of a complaint against GCC officials comes when property taxes are assessed and processed offline. The Greater Chennai Council is strict about officials asking for bribes to give a favourable assessment. In cases of corruption, the GCC advises raising these issues with the Directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption and has provided the numbers 24615989, 24615949 and 24615929.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-latest-information-about-chennai-property-tax\"><strong>Latest information about Chennai property tax</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The Chennai Municipal Corporation was able to collect \u20b9152 crores worth of property taxes which is more than the 132 crores collected during 2019 and \u20b9142 crores in 2018. This three-year high collection was achieved in spite of the raging COVID-19.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">There were mostly adverse reactions to a Garbage Disposal Tax introduced by the Chennai Municipal corporation during January 2021. This additional tax was required to be paid along with the Property tax. Residents were reportedly not happy with the imposition of this additional tax. There was even a demonstration by residents of one of the zones, Pallavaram, for abolishing this tax.

            "content_text": "Property tax, known as Sotthu Virai, is an annual tax on property that needs to be paid by September 30th or March 31st every year. The Chennai corporation tax is levied by the Greater Chennai Corporation.\n\n\n\nThere are several rules and regulations regarding property tax. Payers need to be updated on the different rebates available and the method of calculating the tax to be paid.\n\n\n\nThe Municipal Corporation of Chennai is the oldest municipal corporation to be formed in India back in 1688 on the basis of a 1607 charter by the East India Company. The corporation has increased from its earlier jurisdiction of a 10-mile radius from Fort St. George to now encompass the entire urban radius of Chennai. The size of the corporation has also grown from the 12 aldermen and 60 burgesses under founding Mayor Nathaniel Higginson to more than 250 officers including a Commissioner, Deputy Commissioners, Zonal Officers and Councillors. The corporation is now known as the Greater Chennai Corporation GCC.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe GCC consists of 200 councillors who report to the Mayor of Chennai. There is an executive wing of the Corporation which is headed by the commissioner. Under the commissioner, there are deputy commissioners and 15 zonal officers, one for each of the 15 zones that the 426 sq. km of the city of Chennai has been divided into.\n\n\n\nWhat constitutes residential, non-residential property in Chennai?\n\n\n\nThe classification of residential and non-residential property is very simple. A residential house or apartment which has not been rented or leased out and is being used solely for residential purposes is residential property.\n\n\n\nNon-residential property constitutes shops, malls, movie halls, marriage halls, commercial spaces and plots even if they are not rented and being used by the owner.\n\n\n\nProperty tax rates in Chennai\n\n\n\nThe rates of property taxes for residential property in Chennai vary from Re 0.6 to \u20b92.40 per sq. foot. For non-residential property, the rate for property tax is \u20b94 to \u20b912 per sq. foot.\n\n\n\nZones that fall in Chennai Municipal Corporation\n\n\n\nThe Chennai municipal corporation has 15 zones. The zones from 1 to 15, in the same order, are Thiruvotriyur (Ward Nos 1 -14), Manali (Ward nos 15- 21), Madhavaram (Ward Nos. 22- 33, Tondiarpet (Ward nos. 34 \u2013 48), Royapuram (Ward nos. 49- 63), Thiruvikanagar (Ward nos. 64 \u2013 78), Ambattur (Ward nos. 79 \u2013 93), Anna Nagar (Ward nos. 94- 108), Tynampet (Ward nos. 109- 126), Kodambakkam (Ward nos. 127 -142), Valasaravakkam (ward nos. 143- 155), Alandur (Ward nos. 156- 167), Adyar (Ward nos. 170- 182), Perungudi (ward nos. 168, 169, 183-191) and the fifteenth zone Sholinganalur (ward nos. 192- 200).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPay property tax online in Chennai\n\n\n\nTo pay property tax online in Chennai, a user needs to log in to the site https://chennaigovernemnt.gov.in\u00a0 and select the first option of \u2018property tax payment\u2019 in the online payments section.\n\n\n\nAfter clicking on the property tax icon, the next page that opens will ask for details of bill number, zone number and municipal ward number and a division code. A first-time payer will need to access previous bills.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOnce these requested details have been filled in, the amount that is to be paid will appear. The assessment period is to be filled in and the preferred mode of payment selected from the available options. An acknowledgement will be sent after successful payment. The portal allows a receipt of payment to be generated and printed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOffline Assessment of Property Tax\n\n\n\nThere is an option of choosing to pay the property tax offline. For this option, a filled application form is to be submitted along with receipts of previous taxes paid in any of the centres. The assessors shall submit their findings to the concerned officer and this will require further verification.\n\n\n\nThe applicant shall receive a subsequent SMS on the registered mobile number after the committee clears the assessment for further action including payment of the proposed tax.\n\n\n\nGuide to use the Chennai property tax calculator\n\n\n\nThere is an online property tax calculator installed in the GCC (Greater Chennai Corporation). This can be accessed by filling in the zone and ward numbers. Once these are entered, all the street names and numbers in the selected zone and ward open up in a drop-down menu. The street name is to be selected. After selection, the floor details are to be selected from another drop-down menu.\n\n\n\nThe data entry form asks for a separate selection of residential or non-residential status. In either selection, further details of the area under owner or tenant are to be filled in. if there is no tenant on the property, the tenant portion may be left blank. Once these are all filled in and the \u2018calculate demand\u2019 button clicked, the calculated value will be displayed. The system, however, warns that the calculated value is only a test value.\n\n\n\nAnother way to calculate property tax accurately is as follows:\n\n\n\nAn example is considered for 1500 Sq. Ft area and a rate of \u20b92 per sq. foot. The monthly rental works out to \u20b93000 per month and \u20b936000 for the entire year.\n\n\n\nThe annual rental value is calculated by deducting 10% of the annual value. Thus, the annual rental value for the building is 36000-3600 = 32400.\n\n\n\nAnother 10% is deducted for the depreciation of the building. The calculation is 32400-3240 = Rs 29160\n\n\n\n10% of the land value is now added. After adding the 10% of land value, the annual value for land and building becomes 29160+ 3600 which adds up to \u20b932760.\n\n\n\nMethod of fixing an annual value for land on lease or Rent in Tamil Nadu\n\n\n\nA plot of 2400 Sq. Ft is considered ground and is the basic unit for calculating tax. The rent per ground is \u20b98 per month.\n\n\n\nThe annual value on 1 ground is 8 x 12 = 96.\n\n\n\nThe half-yearly property tax is calculated as a percentage of general tax and education tax minus a library cess.\n\n\n\nFor an annual value up to \u20b9500, the general tax is 3.75% and education tax is 2.5%. This adds up to a total half-yearly property tax of 6.25% from which a library cess of 0.37% is deducted.\n\n\n\nThe rates of tax are 9.25% (6.75% general tax + 2.5% education tax) minus 0.67% library cess for annual values between \u20b9500 to \u20b91000.\n\n\n\nThe calculated half-yearly property tax is 10.25% (7.75% general tax + 2.5% education tax) minus 0.67% library cess for annual values between \u20b91001 to \u20b95000.\n\n\n\nThe rate of half yearly property tax is 11.25% (9% general tax + 2.5% education tax) minus 0.9% library cess for annual values above \u20b95000.\n\n\n\nConcession allowed on property tax in Chennai.\n\n\n\nDepreciation of 1% is permitted for every building that is more than 4 years old.A library cess of 10% of the general tax component is one of the permitted concessions.There is an additional 20% rebate on the monthly rental value for the building roofing provided there is no terrace roofing.There are rebates for self-owned property. For residential structures, the rebate for owner occupancy is 25% of the monthly rental value and 10% on non-residential structures.\n\n\n\nConsequences of not paying the property tax on time\n\n\n\nIf property taxes are not paid within a grace period of 15 days, the GCC (Greater Chennai Corporation) charges a penalty at the rate of 2%. The cost of this penalty is automatically added to the assessment value for the next due payment of tax.\n\n\n\nGetting property tax payment receipt in Chennai\n\n\n\nThe GCC website portal will need to be visited for accessing the payment receipt. In the online tax payment menu, there is a button for \u2018Online payment receipt\u2019. Once this option is selected, details such as the zone number, bill number, division code and sub number will need to be filled in.&nbsp; After filling in these details, the receipt will show up and can be accessed.\n\n\n\nWhat is vacancy Remission?\n\n\n\nVacancy Remission is the provision of providing a rebate on the property that has been lying vacant for at least 30 days during a half-yearly tax term. The GCC commissioner is allowed to allow a rebate of up to 50% as per section 105 of the Chennai City Municipality Corporation (CMCC) Act of 1919.\n\n\n\nHow to register your complaints against officials?\n\n\n\nThe question of a complaint against GCC officials comes when property taxes are assessed and processed offline. The Greater Chennai Council is strict about officials asking for bribes to give a favourable assessment. In cases of corruption, the GCC advises raising these issues with the Directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption and has provided the numbers 24615989, 24615949 and 24615929.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLatest information about Chennai property tax\n\n\n\nThe Chennai Municipal Corporation was able to collect \u20b9152 crores worth of property taxes which is more than the 132 crores collected during 2019 and \u20b9142 crores in 2018. This three-year high collection was achieved in spite of the raging COVID-19.\n\n\n\nThere were mostly adverse reactions to a Garbage Disposal Tax introduced by the Chennai Municipal corporation during January 2021. This additional tax was required to be paid along with the Property tax. Residents were reportedly not happy with the imposition of this additional tax. There was even a demonstration by residents of one of the zones, Pallavaram, for abolishing this tax. The authorities were considering the rollback of this tax.\n\n\n\nThe GCC has considered reducing the 2% penalty on delayed payment of property tax to 0.5%. The GCC is expecting a drop in its revenue collections from property tax, rents and other charges during the financial year 2021-2022. This will be the lowest collection in three years and is expected to be around \u20b92935 crores against a revenue expenditure of \u20b93431.83 crores.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\nVastu Tips to Ward Off Negativity During COVID-19Square Yards and GCC:  A partnership on the riseChennai Property Tax Online Payment: Know all detailsDubai Expo, FIFA World cup and VAT: The engines of growth for GCCChennai real estate markets are more attractive now to buyers\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ&#8217;s)\n\n\n        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhat is the website of the Greater Chennai Corporation?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe websites of the Chennai Municipal corporation are chennaicorporation.gov.in                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tHow old is the Chennai Municipal Corporation?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC), the present name of the Chennai Municipal Corporation was formed as early as 1607 in the erstwhile Fort St. George.

            "content_text": "Circle rates in Delhi have been examined and some relief is announced by both the Central and the State governments. Circle rates are the minimum selling price fixed on the value of property by the Government. Circle rates are different for residential, commercial, and industrial property. Circle rates are also different for agricultural land.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Union Government has allowed the property to be sold up to 20% less value than the prevailing circle rate. This benefit is allowed up to 30 June 2021. Circle rates are regularly reviewed and revised by Government to ensure that the rates are at par if not less than the market value of the property.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow to calculate Circle Rates in Delhi&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe circle rates of commercial property are higher than those of residential property. There is also an age multiplier factor for the property. There is a multiplier factor of 1 for buildings built in the year 2000 up to the present. There are factors of 0.5 to 0.9 for older buildings, the oldest building getting the lowest multiplier factor.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCircle rates can be calculated by visiting the site \u2018eval.delhigovt.nic.in\u2019 which asks for all details and parameters and calculates the circle value.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe site will ask for the name of the sub-registrar office, locality, deed name, and sub deed name. On entering these details, the circle rate will automatically be calculated by the portal based on prevailing rates.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo calculate the circle rate manually, the following sequential steps are to be followed:\n\n\n\nThe first stage is to differentiate whether the property is residential or commercial.The next stage is to identify the type of construction (Flat, apartment, independent house) or simply a plot of land without any construction. The circle rates are different for each of these types of construction.&nbsp;The age multiplier based on the number of years the construction has been standing is also to be used.For an independent plot, the plot area in sq meter is to be multiplied by the circle rate for land.For DDA and society flats and builder floors, the minimum cost of construction is multiplied by the built-up area in sq meter and the age multiplier.For multistorey flats, the flat\u2019s built-up area in sq meter is multiplied by the circle rate for flats in that particular locality.For a home built on a plot of land, the circle value for the land is to be calculated. The plot area in sq meter is multiplied by the circle rate for land in that locality. Next, the built-up area of the house in sq meter is multiplied by the minimum construction cost and the multiplier age factor. The calculated values of land and the home are added together to arrive at the final value.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow to calculate property value in Delhi using circle rate?\n\n\n\nThe following procedure is to be followed for calculating property value in Delhi by using the circle rates fixed by the government.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDifferent values such as the plot area, built-up area, amenities, age of the building, and the number of floors are to be determined.Selection of the type of construction is done at this stage. The appropriate type is selected from the choices of commercial, residential, apartment, builder floor, or shop.The next selection is the locality.After this, the age factor is to be determined and multiplied by the area and the circle rate of the property.\n\n\n\nCircle rates \u2013 Age Factor in New Delhi\n\n\n\nThere are different age factors fixed for a different number of years for buildings. A building before 1960 has a factor of 0.5, buildings built between 1960-1960 have 0.6, 0.7 for buildings in between 1970- 1979, 0.8 for buildings between 1980-1989, 0.9 for buildings built between 1990-1999, and a factor of 1 for buildings built during\u00a02000 and beyond.\u00a0\n\n\n\nCircle Rates for flats in New Delhi\n\n\n\nThe circle rates for flats in New Delhi are calculated based on the following criteria:\n\n\n\nFor a flat of area up to 30 sq meters, the rate per sq meter for DDA and society flats is Rs 50400 and for private flats is Rs 55400. There is a multiplying factor of 1.1 for private coloniesFor a flat of area 35-50 sq meters, the rate per sq meter for DDA and society flats is Rs 54480 and for private flats is Rs 62652.
