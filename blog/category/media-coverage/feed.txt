										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify">Square Yards, the country’s foremost integrated real estate platform, based in Gurugram, has raised $25 million or approximately Rs. 185 crore from global investment manager ADM Capital which currently has $2.4 billion of assets under management throughout Europe and the Asia Pacific. This new infusion of growth capital is the first tranche of Square Yards’ ongoing goals of raising more than $100 million in capital in the near future. The company will be using this capital to continue expansion and investments in several verticals throughout the entire value chain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Founder &amp; CEO at Square Yards, Tanuj Shori, stated that Square Yard has been mostly capital efficient from inception with a clear emphasis on ensuring higher ROI. The company has met important operational benchmarks over the last year including profitability and also the pilot success of its new ventures like home interiors, property management and rentals among others. He added that Square Yards is now at the cusp of accelerating further growth while adding that with a stronger institutional partner such as ADM Capital, the company can push forward aggressively towards accomplishing both personal and brand investments with a view towards ensuring a swifter growth trajectory.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Square Yards is already developing an integrated service ecosystem both inorganically and organically. It acquired platform capabilities recently in data intelligence, VR and property management/rentals while launching a full service platform that offers home interior and home furnishing solutions. The Co-Founding Partner and Joint Chief Investment Officer, ADM Capital, Christopher Botsford, stated that they are happy to back Square Yards in its future growth pursuits and will continue looking for more opportunities to support leading Indian corporates who are aiming at disrupting conventional industries. He added that the company is also happy with the willingness of Square Yards to scale up its social and environmental policies and can share expertise, taking ADM Capital’s proven capabilities of enhancing borrower governance and mitigation of ESG risks into account.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">ADM Capital was founded in 1998, offering flexible credit options to top midsized corporates in the Asia Pacific. ADM Capital forayed into the Indian market around 2004 and has since deployed more than $670 million throughout 18 private financings. ADM Capital emphasizes greatly on stronger corporate governance and social and environmental compliance alike. Integrated strategies have been influencing the proptech space globally and top entities like Compass, Zillow and Beike are building digital integrated consumer experiences spanning all transactional aspects involving the buy-and-sell part, helping them capture a bigger slice of the entire transaction. Square Yards has been pioneering an integrated ecosystem based model and is one of the few global realty platforms that provide the entire full stack digital realty journey encompassing transactions, search and discovery, home interiors, mortgages, property management, rentals and after-sales services. Square Yards also provides B2B SaaS solutions for real estate developers, banks, realty agents and financial institutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: 400">Residential real estate sales figures were steady between January and March, 2021 although they fell in the quarter between April and June, with the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic leading to countrywide lockdowns. Demand has improved a little since the month of June and for those seeking to purchase a home for end-use, experts feel that this is the best possible time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: 400">Demand is steadily coming back to the market. In some business sectors like IT, employees have garnered decent bonuses and salary hikes even for FY2020-21 and with projected 8.5-10% of economic growth in 2021-22, purchasing power may be enhanced more. The current hybrid working model may continue, prompting many buyers to switch from rented apartments in prime locations near their offices to their own homes on the periphery of major cities. Some are also upgrading to bigger housing units with ample space for setting up a home office. Some property platforms have confirmed that 35-40% of buyers are seeking to upgrade their homes. Real estate prices have mostly remained static or corrected in major markets with some markets witnessing only slim 2-3% gains annually for more than 8 years. The chances of prices falling downwards after a prolonged downward spiral are very less as per industry experts.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: 400">Several developers have already revised pricing since commodity costs have gone up for them, spurring higher input expenditure. New projects will automatically account for these extra costs and be priced at higher rates. Multi-year lows in ready to move inventory in cities like Mumbai and Delhi indicates clear buyer preference in this category. Principal Partner &amp; Director Sales at Square Yards, <strong>Kapil Malhotra</strong>, feels that prices may inch upwards if recovery happens smoothly. Home loan interest rates are already at their lowest thresholds. After Maharashtra’s example, even West Bengal has reduced stamp duty and circle rates. The Delhi Government has also lowered circle rates till 30</span><span style="font-weight: 400">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> September, 2021. These new developments may reduce buyer costs even further.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: 400">Malhotra opines that Grade A developers may not always offer discounts on properties although buyers may still be able to negotiate 8-10% discounts from Grade B and Grade C developers although these may withdraw with a pick-up in demand. Some realty players are still providing 9:91 or 20:80 payment plans although the quantum of offers is much lower. Many peripheral zones are also benefiting from the advent of metro railway connectivity and several new areas are emerging as favored destinations in cities like Hyderabad and Bengaluru where rates are still attractive.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: 400">Experts feel that buying for end-use is only advisable if there is low income risk and the buyer is certain that he/she will reside in a particular area with family for a minimum of 10 years. If not, then the purchase should now be deferred and savings invested in other channels as per experts. Expenditure of 8-10% of the price will be incurred in a single round of sale and purchase. Hence, living for 10 years will at least justify this expenditure. There are risks of a third wave of the coronavirus and single income households may be under pressure to arrange around 20% of the cost as down payment while having a minimum corpus of 24 months of home loan EMIs and arrange a hedge against any job losses and financial risks. 24 months will suffice for double income households where spouses may take care of expenses. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify">Integrated real estate platform Square Yards, based in Gurugram, has on-boarded more than 5,000 co-branded stores in India’s top 8 cities via its Preferred Partner Program. This innovative endeavor is specifically tailored for independent real estate agents along with smaller agencies. The partners will have seamless access for all Square Yards ecosystem products including exclusive inventory courtesy of Grade A real estate developers, home furnishing and property management solutions and mortgage platforms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">These preferred partners have been identified by Square Yards from its current 150,000+ agent partners who have obtained registration on Square Connect, the mobile-based aggregation platform. The CEO &amp; Founder at Square Yards, Tanuj Shori, stated that the agents are on-boarded into the proprietary gamified algorithm where they are scored on the basis of numerous parameters such as customer interactions, listing quality, reporting of transactions and platform based activities. The best will automatically be chosen for the preferred partner program and they will receive complete marketing and branding support from Square Yards for giving a boost to their offline and online presence according to him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">According to Tanuj Shori, the proptech player is aiming for 30,000 co-branded stores by the end of the next financial year. The Chief Business Officer, Channel Management, Sumit Jain, stated that the effort is to build a business that is fully in sync with smaller agents who have been mostly underserved by innovation in the industry. He added that whenever agents are successful, Square Yards will also succeed likewise. Hence, the company remains committed towards ushering path breaking technologies and marketing solutions for enabling agents to work swifter and smarter according to him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Square Yards stated that there are almost 1.5 million independent real estate agents in the country who account for almost 70% of sales figures of new housing units and close to 100% of existing home sales figures while also accounting for 80% of all rental transactions in India. The agents play a vital role in realty industry transactions while they do not have either the affordable marketing solutions or the technological expertise to actually flourish. Square Yards agent tech solutions have opened up a new avenue for independent realty professionals, enabling them to market their home listings, source demand from the Square Yards marketplace based platform, get personalized websites with ratings and reviews, manage their teams via integrated CRM, enable online agreements via digital escrow, account for e-signing and e-payment facilities and also interact with fellow industry brokers via integrated features for social networking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Agents may also be able to offer ancillary products including home furnishings, home loans and property management, enabling them to offer more touch points to clients throughout the process of buying property and also for generating steady income to supplement their existing earnings by just renting or selling properties as per the official Square Yards statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: 400">With the pandemic raging nationwide, several owners of apartments have had to deal with situations where their tenants left for their hometowns or cities. Their investment homes have been lying empty although the owners still have to account for costs of EMIs on home loans, maintenance and property taxes. Reports indicate that 11-25% of residential homes are lying vacant in key cities. On average, rental yields are just 2-2.5% while maintenance costs and property taxes further reduce this down to 1.5-2%. Along with lower returns, many homeowners do not rent out properties based on fears that tenants may refuse to vacate the same.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: 400">When it comes to investing in rental homes, there are mixed perceptions held by industry experts. Some feel that waiting for 2-3 years may be wise. They opine that investments in residential housing are primarily geared towards achieving appreciation in capital values. However, prices have been reducing over the last 5 years and may not appreciate over the next two years or so. Some experts call this a good time to deploy investments. Prices have remained at stagnant levels for quite some time while having bottomed out as well. Buying for the long haul makes sense in this scenario.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: 400">Capital appreciation of approximately 7-8% and rental yields of 2-3% per annum may be expected over a decade according to experts, pushing overall returns up to 10-11%. Developers are more willing to negotiate on house prices and are offering attractive payment plans currently. There are some other aspects favoring rental housing at the moment. Rents will be revised periodically and hence you will earn returns adjusted for inflation. You can also put 30% of your capital and obtain a loan of about 70%, hence enjoying leverage benefits. Escalation in prices will take place on the entire 100%. Location should be key criteria if you are looking to invest. Purchase in a zone where there are IT parks, offices and commercial centers nearby along with the metro and good facilities of public transportation. With regard to the sizes of apartments, focus more on what is known as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">rental value fit</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. Each locality will draw specific sets of renters who are prepared to pay specific levels of rent. Find out this level for your area and then purchase property of a suitable size according to Chief Business Officer, Rental Business, Square Yards, Altaf Ahmad.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: 400">Home owners should also be prepared to compromise a little over the next few months on rent. Rather than sticking to what they were getting last, they should ideally compromise with a few thousand rupees and get the income flowing once again. Owners are anyway liable to pay taxes even for vacant properties. <strong>Altaf Ahmad</strong> also cautions owners against demanding a security deposit that is too hefty or excessively large. Ahmad advises owners to focus more on rates at which the last 5 transactions have been executed nearby. Aggregators like PropsAMC have such information available online.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: 400">Combat your fears of the property being taken over by tenants and instead get good legal help for drafting a solid agreement. Choose the leave and license agreement instead of only a lease agreement. Leave and license will only grant temporary property usage rights while lease agreements transfer some interest in a property. Some things to note include the fact that actual rent should be equal to or higher than reasonable rental determined by your municipality. These tips will help home owners greatly.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;line-height: 26.2pt;text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">After posting record sales figures in the quarter between January and March of CY2021, the realty sector witnessed another drop after lockdowns were announced throughout India for fighting the second COVID-19 wave. As per reports, sales figures in Q2 CY2021 may go 58% lower than the earlier quarter since just 24,570 units may be sold as compared to 58,290 sold in Q1 CY2021. Yet, homebuyers are slowly returning to the property market with developers and consultants confirming 40-50% of footfalls seen before the second wave. Lockdowns are slowly being eased and owing to changed circumstances, things may actually be in favor of homebuyers as per industry experts.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;line-height: 26.2pt;text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">Interest rates are already at a decade-low threshold on home loans, improving overall home buyer affordability levels. With borrowing costs being lower, EMIs for loans will also be lesser. Inflation has raised anxieties about rates increasing in the future although experts feel this is unlikely to happen. The RBI has clearly indicated focus on boosting growth in spite of inflation remaining higher throughout this year. RBI will push more liquidity through bond purchase blueprints. This will restrict bond yields and limit interest rate growth as well, as per experts. Banks are unlikely to increase deposit rates owing to lower corporate credit demand.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;line-height: 26.2pt;text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">Banks will instead push for more retail loans. Construction activity continued during the lockdown this year since guidelines were not as stringent like last year when it fully halted. Several developers will face some delays owing to shortage of labor and workers leaving cities for villages prior to the lockdown being enforced, for the harvest season. Yet, laborers are returning to their sites and things will improve for developers who have streamlined contractor payments. The fears relating to another COVID-19 third wave are still present and may impact construction activity in the future. Hence buyers are more inclined towards ready to move units at present.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;line-height: 26.2pt;text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">Several States reduced stamp duty for a limited duration for enhancing realty sales, leading to record figures for Q1 Cy21. Yet, the Maharashtra Government has not extended this cut in stamp duty. The deadline for CLSS under PMAY for MIG 1 and MIG 2 has also expired. Yet, developers are still giving ample incentives for buyers. Offers still exist like attractive payment plans, paying rentals until possession and so on. Developers are giving discounts for sealing apartment deals as per several experts. Prices of real estate are at their lowest in this period as well. Poor sales figures and high inventory have made sure that housing prices remain muted for a long time now. The RBI’s housing price index indicated 1.1% growth in Q3 FY2020-21. Costs of construction have however increased by 10% as per estimates. COO &amp; Co-Founder, Square Yards, Kanika Gupta Shori, has stated that prices of real estate may go up by approximately 5-8% by end-2021 since input costs have gone up considerably and industry leaders are also talking about the mounting pressure on wafer-thin margins. She opined that the price increase percentage may vary across real estate markets although prices will start increasing.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify">Buying a home is one of the largest investments made by people in their lifetime. Any wrong decision, particularly in case of under construction properties, may lead to sizable troubles in the future. Several home buyers are still awaiting possession of their homes even after a decade or more, with numerous projects being junked or stalled, even after major payments were made dutifully by prospective buyers. Refunds are yet to turn up even after several years of legal battles. For lowering risks, there are some sources that buyers should always turn to.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Co-Founder and Head-NRI Sales, Square Yards, <strong>Anupam Rastogi</strong>, states that home buyers should login to the RERA website and check the details of a promoter including the name, project details over the last 5 years and contact information. This will help buyers understand the builder’s overall competency. The RERA Act makes it mandatory for developers, projects and agents to get registration numbers. Every project should have its own registration number, mentioned in all communication and advertisements. Buyers should verify the RERA registration aspect on the website itself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Rastogi states that buyers can also access details like project type, name, address, area, parking area, estimated construction cost, approving authority, project status, completion year and total project cost. Buyers should be careful about verifying construction work details in the <em>project status</em> section. Information like development pending, total amount collected from all allottees, amount invested in the project, delay in the project, reason for delay and expected date of completion will indicate the credibility of the developer according to him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Buyers should also check the permissions and approvals obtained for any particular project. Developers also have to report details of cases filed against them. Other experts also feel that buyers should check the financial status of developers which is difficult in case of unlisted market players. Rastogi states that home buyers should verify aspects like whether developers have defaulted on payments to banks for loans, legality of a project and balance sheet. If it is an unlisted player, buyers may get information from the MCA (Ministry of Corporate Affairs) website courtesy the <em>view public documents</em> section according to him. He also states that they can check the CERSAI (Central Registry of Securitisation Asset Reconstruction and Security Interest of India) for checking whether the property is mortgaged with any housing finance company or bank.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Home buyers should also get feedback on after-sales service and construction quality from people living in properties developed by any particular builder. Home buyers can get an idea about the material quality, fittings and electrical equipment, amenities offered, whether they are separately charged or whether the cost is included in the total apartment cost as per Rastogi. He adds that home buyer feedback will help in taking the right decisions. Social media sites are ideal places to read about testimonials of fellow home buyers and clients as per Rastogi. Other experts also agree on newspapers and social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn being helpful for getting information first-hand.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gurugram has been ranked as the most suitable Indian city to live during the COVID-19 pandemic, taking into factors like open area ratio, population density and hospital infrastructure. The latest report by Square Yards named </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suitability Index</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID Perspective</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has shed light on the suitability of residing and working in three key Indian cities, namely Mumbai, Gurugram and Bengaluru amidst the backdrop of COVID-19. The report states that the above-mentioned parameters assume greater importance over distance from workplace or affordability for deciding on where homebuyers wish to live in COVID-19 times. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gurugram is the most suitable Indian city from this perspective with areas in the East zone like Sectors 40-44, 52-56, 24-27 and 30 ranked as the most suitable for living in the current scenario based upon the index. Although density of COVID-19 cases in the zone stood second only to the North zone, the presence of the highest number of hospitals for every 10,000 people, more than 40% of open areas and the lowest population density led to the higher ranking on livability grounds. Mahadevapura was the most suitable area to live in Bengaluru. Other favored localities in this zone included Devasandra, Bellandur and Marathahalli. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Localities in the PN and N wards in Mumbai, which majorly make up the Western suburbs and Central suburbs, were the most suitable for living at this time. Both Bengaluru and Mumbai have just 0.30 and 1.3 hospitals for every 10,000 people as per this study while Gurugram has 2.5 hospitals for every 10,000 people. Mumbai contained 13 out of 24 wards hugely impacted with 50+ cases for every 10,000 people. The east and north zones in Gurugram had averages of 55 cases per square kilometer and four out of eight zones in Bengaluru had 200+ cases per square kilometer. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suitability index for various zones was majorly impacted in Bengaluru and Mumbai by two key parameters, i.e. number of COVID-19 cases and population density. The report indicates that Mumbai has the highest open area ratio out of these three cities at almost 45%. Mumbai was also the highest populated with 60,000 people per square kilometer while Gurgaon had the lowest population density of 4200 people per square kilometer. The Business Head- Data Intelligence &amp; Asset Management Services- Square Yards, Anand Moorthy, stated that Suitability Index is a way of bringing together multiple non-transaction elements into the spotlight which may have a direct impact while taking home buying decisions. He added that the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">new normal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will stay for some time now and the idea here is to unearth factors other than affordability or proximity to the workplace with regard to impacting home choices.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Model Tenancy Act, 2021 was approved on the 2</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of June by the Union Cabinet and has balanced the whole system between tenants and landlords as per industry experts. States already possess laws dealing with leasing and renting properties and the MTA will be swapping the current Rent Control Act of the States, if it is adopted by them. According to experts, the Rent Control Act is tilted in the tenants’ favor and States have attempted to bring both parties on a level playing field by modifying current laws although the MTA will be a better option according to them. States will have powers for modifying the MTA or not adopting the same at all in the future. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some experts feel that the MTA being part of the Concurrent List, is recommended for implementation to States although it is not compulsory. It is more like a guideline on policies for States and this is why it merited approval of the Union Cabinet and not the Parliament. RERA deals with protection of buyers without directly tackling property laws. Hence, it was passed in the Houses of Parliament. The MTA necessitates establishment of a rent authority in States for regulating the leasing/renting of premises. Once the tenant and property owner sign the leave and license agreement, they will have to intimate the authority within a period of two months. The proposed authority will be issuing a unique ID and will take decisions if there are disputes based upon submitted facts. States will also have to establish rent tribunals and rent courts for dispute resolution. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Landlords have had major concerns regarding squatting, with many keeping homes locked instead of renting them out on this account. In a few States such as Maharashtra, it is compulsory to get leave and license agreements registered under the Government. Still some time is required to get relief from courts as far as landlords are concerned, in case tenants do not leave the property. The MTA has a time period of 60 days for passing the order and this will give a host of confidence to landlords with regard to renting out their properties as per the <strong>Co-Founder, Azuro, a subsidiary of Square Yards, Sudhanshu Mishra</strong>, that offers property management and rental solutions. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other experts feel that rent authorities will be handling a far higher volume of cases than those falling under the purview of RERA. There is no standard practice for security deposits in India. Chennai and Bengaluru, amongst other southern cities, may have 6-10 months as deposit period while it is 2-3 months for Delhi. Standard deposit timeframes will help in bringing about a level playing field for tenants as well. The Act limits the deposit to two months of rent for residential properties while this is a maximum of six months for non-residential properties. Sudhanshu Mishra also feels that landlords may perceive ample security deposit as their sole leverage although there are other Model Tenancy Act provisions which offer higher power to them as compared to the existing laws. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most disputes crop up at the time of the tenant vacating the property as per industry experts. The Act offers multiple scenarios for handling disputes whenever owners want tenants to vacate the premises. Landlords may get compensation if there is adequate notice given to the tenant regarding the terms and conditions in the agreement but the latter does not vacate the property. This is double of the monthly rent for two months and four times of the monthly rent afterwards. If any force majeure applies like a natural calamity or any unprecedented scenario, owners should allow tenants to retain possession for a month post the cessation of any such incident. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experts feel that implantation of RERA throughout States had challenges since developers did resist it initially. There are no such powerful lobbies in case of the MTA according to them. Both landlords and tenants want to have their rights secured and want swifter implementation above all else. Hence, more States may implement the MTA even faster than they implemented RERA according to several experts. The Act extends solely to new agreements although some opine that earlier agreements between tenants and landlords should have been covered for truly enhancing overall confidence in the same. Some also feel that the Act should also have clearly laid down the role played by property brokers in these transactions while laying down the minimum compensation to be received by them. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Model Tenancy Act will set up an independent authority in every Indian State and Union Territory for registering tenant agreements. A separate court will be covering tenancy-linked disputes and the advance security deposit of tenants will be restricted to two months’ rent at the most while it will be a maximum of 6 months for non-residential needs. The Model Tenancy Act will enable unlocking vacant homes for rental housing purposes. The Act will apply for premises let out for commercial, residential and educational usage. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experts and industry leaders like Dr. Niranjan Hiranandani have stated that the Act will make sure that there is ample new rental housing stock created for all income groups. The Act will help in unlocking vacant homes for purposes of rental housing. It will give a major boost for private participants in rental housing as a unique business model for tackling the shortage of housing. The Act will facilitate institutionalization of rental housing by shifting it gradually to the formal market. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Model Tenancy Act will have provisions for regulation of rights and duties for both tenants and landlords as per Shishir Baijal, Chairman &amp; Managing Director at Knight Frank India. Chairman at ANAROCK Property Consultants, Anuj Puri, has stated that this Act will help in bridging the deficit in trust between landlords and tenants. Mani Rangarajan, the Group COO at Makaan.com, Housing.com and PropTiger.com, has stated that the Act will set up a Rent Authority for regulation of renting premises in a more transparent and efficient way. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industry players like Rohit Poddar, Managing Director at Poddar Housing and Development Ltd, have opined that the approved Act will help in regulation and promotion of rental housing in India. <strong>Altaf Ahmad</strong>, <strong>the</strong> <strong>CBO, Rental Business, Square Yards</strong>, the Model Tenancy Act is expected to help in unlocking massive residential stock. The Cabinet has issued its approval for the Act while indicating its desire to transform an unorganized market into an organized one according to him. He also stated that owing to being unregulated, the residential rental category has always remained </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">unscrupulous</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Act will help in cleaning up the rental sector while tackling aspects like security and rent along with safeguarding the rights of tenants and tempering rate of increase in rentals. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahmad also opined that the Act will help in unlocking huge volumes of rental housing stock currently lying vacant. Built homes staying vacant are a major irony in India where shortage of housing is a big issue. The Act will solve this problem while drawing more private sector participants into the rental housing category. The Act will be a two-dimensional solution as per Ahmad, i.e. helping in formalizing rental markets in India and also contributing towards lowering housing shortage in India. This will aid the mission of the Government named </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing for All by 2022</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Act will bring major relief to the rental housing sector as universally opined by all leading industry experts. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">India’s foremost real estate brokerage platform Square Yards has officially announced its foray into the home interiors and furnishing sector as part of its blueprint towards offering full-stack solutions to customers.&nbsp;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The residential realty category was a ray of hope in 2020 for the industry at large. The sector successfully avoided the curveball thrown by the COVID-19 pandemic, showing excellent resilience and posting massive sales figures for Q3 and Q4 alike. This has set the foundation for better recovery in 2021 as well. The COO and Co-Founder at Square Yards, <strong>Kanika Gupta Shori</strong>, has opined that the housing market is witnessing positive growth with 80% of potential buyers seeking to acquire their homes within a year while 65% of them prefer ready to move in homes for 2021. Ownership sentiments continue remaining strong according to Shori and this has been influenced by flexible plans for payment, discounts, lower rates of interest and the overall ease of buying a home with enhanced technological convenience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shori has stated that confidence of homebuyers is steadily touching new highs with tax benefits being extended for affordable housing along with affordable rental housing ventures in tandem with interest deduction in the recent budget for a year and the stay on repo rates by the RBI. This will keep buyer volumes stronger in the sector owing to more favorable parameters. Housing demand is also shifting steadily towards lower-density markets as per Shori while other demand drivers include cuts in stamp duty across Mumbai, Delhi-NCR and Karnataka while low rates on home loans continue to be a key factor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this context, she has highlighted some major trends that will influence the sector greatly throughout 2021-</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Evolution and innovation of proptech entities- Proptech has played a leading role in helping the whole sector and enabling continuity of business throughout the coronavirus pandemic. Developers and buyers are now relying more on emerging technologies for efficient and smarter transactions along with property leasing and management experiences. Shori predicts this trend to gain momentum in the coming months of 2021 with most buyers having shifted towards online real estate platforms. Developers have woken up to the indispensable proptech aspect while firms in this sector will keep evolving and innovating further.</li>
<li>Sustenance of housing demand- The excellent performance of residential real estate for Q3 and then even better figures in Q4 (sales figures went up by 51% on a quarter on quarter basis) across the 7 big markets are indicators of momentum staying strong throughout 2021. Affordable housing will continue being a major demand driver while affordable rental housing ventures will also flourish as per Shori. She feels that luxury and mid-range properties will also draw decent volumes with more people inclined towards upgrading their homes for more usable and multi-functional spaces.</li>
<li>Swifter industry consolidation- Demand consolidation of buyers will take place more towards developers with good track records, financial stability, capabilities of large-scale execution and those offering high-quality residential projects. They will keep gaining considerable market share in 2021 since smaller players will be constrained owing to limited availability of funding, narrowing margins and shifting preferences of buyers towards leading brands. This consolidation will lead to a more organized industry while highlighting the premium property category too.</li>
<li>Slight increase in real estate prices- In spite of vaccine roll-out and economic recovery, property prices have a slim chance of increasing in 2021. Based upon latest reports, unsold inventory in India’s top 8 cities currently stands at a whopping 9.5 lakh units. It will take more than 2 years to bring this down to a sustainable threshold even though sales figures have outstripped new launches. Yet, some pockets may witness a slight property price rise.</li>
<li>Boom in tier-2 markets and suburbs- A remote working culture, reverse migration and aspirations for a better life will lead to higher housing demand in Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities in India. Buyers are seeking homes which are priced at least 30-40% lower than those in metro cities. Alongside, the 5-year rental outgo for tenants staying in cities is equivalent to at least 30-50% of costs of property in smaller cities. This logic will drive a housing demand boom in satellite cities and towns.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shori feels that 2021 will usher in better growth, positivity, investments and innovation as far as the residential real estate segment is concerned.</p>
