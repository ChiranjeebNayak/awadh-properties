The current hybrid working model may continue, prompting many buyers to switch from rented apartments in prime locations near their offices to their own homes on the periphery of major cities.

States already possess laws dealing with leasing and renting properties and the MTA will be swapping the current Rent Control Act of the States, if it is adopted by them. According to experts, the Rent Control Act is tilted in the tenants\u2019 favor and States have attempted to bring both parties on a level playing field by modifying current laws although the MTA will be a better option according to them. States will have powers for modifying the MTA or not adopting the same at all in the future.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some experts feel that the MTA being part of the Concurrent List, is recommended for implementation to States although it is not compulsory. It is more like a guideline on policies for States and this is why it merited approval of the Union Cabinet and not the Parliament. RERA deals with protection of buyers without directly tackling property laws. Hence, it was passed in the Houses of Parliament. The MTA necessitates establishment of a rent authority in States for regulating the leasing/renting of premises. Once the tenant and property owner sign the leave and license agreement, they will have to intimate the authority within a period of two months. The proposed authority will be issuing a unique ID and will take decisions if there are disputes based upon submitted facts. States will also have to establish rent tribunals and rent courts for dispute resolution.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Landlords have had major concerns regarding squatting, with many keeping homes locked instead of renting them out on this account. In a few States such as Maharashtra, it is compulsory to get leave and license agreements registered under the Government. Still some time is required to get relief from courts as far as landlords are concerned, in case tenants do not leave the property. The MTA has a time period of 60 days for passing the order and this will give a host of confidence to landlords with regard to renting out their properties as per the <strong>Co-Founder, Azuro, a subsidiary of Square Yards, Sudhanshu Mishra</strong>, that offers property management and rental solutions.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other experts feel that rent authorities will be handling a far higher volume of cases than those falling under the purview of RERA. There is no standard practice for security deposits in India. Chennai and Bengaluru, amongst other southern cities, may have 6-10 months as deposit period while it is 2-3 months for Delhi. Standard deposit timeframes will help in bringing about a level playing field for tenants as well. The Act limits the deposit to two months of rent for residential properties while this is a maximum of six months for non-residential properties. Sudhanshu Mishra also feels that landlords may perceive ample security deposit as their sole leverage although there are other Model Tenancy Act provisions which offer higher power to them as compared to the existing laws.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most disputes crop up at the time of the tenant vacating the property as per industry experts. The Act offers multiple scenarios for handling disputes whenever owners want tenants to vacate the premises. Landlords may get compensation if there is adequate notice given to the tenant regarding the terms and conditions in the agreement but the latter does not vacate the property. This is double of the monthly rent for two months and four times of the monthly rent afterwards. If any force majeure applies like a natural calamity or any unprecedented scenario, owners should allow tenants to retain possession for a month post the cessation of any such incident.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experts feel that implantation of RERA throughout States had challenges since developers did resist it initially. There are no such powerful lobbies in case of the MTA according to them. Both landlords and tenants want to have their rights secured and want swifter implementation above all else. Hence, more States may implement the MTA even faster than they implemented RERA according to several experts. The Act extends solely to new agreements although some opine that earlier agreements between tenants and landlords should have been covered for truly enhancing overall confidence in the same. Some also feel that the Act should also have clearly laid down the role played by property brokers in these transactions while laying down the minimum compensation to be received by them. </span></p>\n<p>For a detailed report on this read the articles we were featured in:</p>\n<p>Mint : https://bit.ly/2TLieLb</p>\n<p>Published Date: June 8, 2021</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/new-model-tenancy-act-achieves-a-balance-between-landlords-and-tenants\">New Model Tenancy Act achieves a balance between landlords and tenants</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog\">Real Estate News</a>.</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The residential realty category was a ray of hope in 2020 for the industry at large. The sector successfully avoided the curveball thrown by the COVID-19 pandemic, showing excellent resilience and posting massive sales figures for Q3 and Q4 alike. This has set the foundation for better recovery in 2021 as well. The COO and Co-Founder at Square Yards, <strong>Kanika Gupta Shori</strong>, has opined that the housing market is witnessing positive growth with 80% of potential buyers seeking to acquire their homes within a year while 65% of them prefer ready to move in homes for 2021. Ownership sentiments continue remaining strong according to Shori and this has been influenced by flexible plans for payment, discounts, lower rates of interest and the overall ease of buying a home with enhanced technological convenience.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shori has stated that confidence of homebuyers is steadily touching new highs with tax benefits being extended for affordable housing along with affordable rental housing ventures in tandem with interest deduction in the recent budget for a year and the stay on repo rates by the RBI. This will keep buyer volumes stronger in the sector owing to more favorable parameters. Housing demand is also shifting steadily towards lower-density markets as per Shori while other demand drivers include cuts in stamp duty across Mumbai, Delhi-NCR and Karnataka while low rates on home loans continue to be a key factor.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In this context, she has highlighted some major trends that will influence the sector greatly throughout 2021-</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Evolution and innovation of proptech entities- Proptech has played a leading role in helping the whole sector and enabling continuity of business throughout the coronavirus pandemic. Developers and buyers are now relying more on emerging technologies for efficient and smarter transactions along with property leasing and management experiences. Shori predicts this trend to gain momentum in the coming months of 2021 with most buyers having shifted towards online real estate platforms. Developers have woken up to the indispensable proptech aspect while firms in this sector will keep evolving and innovating further.</li>\n<li>Sustenance of housing demand- The excellent performance of residential real estate for Q3 and then even better figures in Q4 (sales figures went up by 51% on a quarter on quarter basis) across the 7 big markets are indicators of momentum staying strong throughout 2021. Affordable housing will continue being a major demand driver while affordable rental housing ventures will also flourish as per Shori. She feels that luxury and mid-range properties will also draw decent volumes with more people inclined towards upgrading their homes for more usable and multi-functional spaces.</li>\n<li>Swifter industry consolidation- Demand consolidation of buyers will take place more towards developers with good track records, financial stability, capabilities of large-scale execution and those offering high-quality residential projects. They will keep gaining considerable market share in 2021 since smaller players will be constrained owing to limited availability of funding, narrowing margins and shifting preferences of buyers towards leading brands. This consolidation will lead to a more organized industry while highlighting the premium property category too.</li>\n<li>Slight increase in real estate prices- In spite of vaccine roll-out and economic recovery, property prices have a slim chance of increasing in 2021. Based upon latest reports, unsold inventory in India\u2019s top 8 cities currently stands at a whopping 9.5 lakh units.

Buyers are seeking homes which are priced at least 30-40% lower than those in metro cities. Alongside, the 5-year rental outgo for tenants staying in cities is equivalent to at least 30-50% of costs of property in smaller cities.
