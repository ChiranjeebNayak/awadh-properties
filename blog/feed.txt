										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-justify">The Lakshmi Vilas Palace is one of the most magnificent mansions ever created, set among enormous gardens, mango orchards, and sweeping fields. It was commissioned in 1880 by Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III and is four times the size of Buckingham Palace, with a total area of 700 acres.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The magnificent palace, which was completed in about 1890 has been the residence of the Gaekwads, the rulers of the Princely State of Baroda, Gujarat for more than a century. The Palace compound includes numerous additional institutes, including the Baroda Golf Club, the Maharaja Fatehsinhrao Museum, and Motibaug Cricket Grounds, all of which are located inside its enormous property. The palace grounds are so large that they previously hosted a small zoo and a miniature train line to transport the royal children around. Due to the employment of domes, minarets, and arches, the palace is a perfect blend of Hindu, Mughal, and Gothic architectural styles.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-project-s-doomed-architect"><strong>The Project&#8217;s Doomed Architect</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The project&#8217;s lead architect Major Charles Mant was a well-known architect during his time. The Lakshmi Vilas was his most ambitious undertaking, having constructed palaces at Darbhanga, Bihar, and Kolhapur. Despite being an enthusiastic architect, he was believed to suffer from melancholy and paranoia, eventually leading to his death midway through the project.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">His death is said to have been the result of a suicide attempt motivated by fear. There are two theories as to what caused the anxiety or shame that drove him to such extremes. The first claims that he was concerned that his calculations were incorrect, and that the palace might collapse at any moment.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The other claims that an inverted North symbol on the blueprints caused the palace to be erected in the mirror image of the design. As a result, the palace&#8217;s main entrance is on the backside. In any case, the architect died in the middle of the project, and Robert Fellows Chisolm was hired to take his place. Robert Fellows Chisholm, the designer architect, spent twelve years completing this magnificent edifice.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-magnificent-palace"><strong>The Magnificent Palace</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The palace was constructed for GBP 180,000 and had modern amenities such as elevators, an internal telephone system, and an electricity supply. The mansion was meant to be the most lavish edifice in the Baroda State, using materials sourced from all around the state. Even the building workers were only the best, and in some instances, they were even brought in from overseas.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The palace&#8217;s facade is made of golden stone from Songadh mines, which gives it a distinctive golden light when seen in the dark and morning. The palace&#8217;s exterior is adorned with elements such as tiny domed &#8220;chattris&#8221; with finials, cusped arched entries, and jharokha windows, all in the Indo-Saracenic design. The outside is also decorated with finely carved stone patterns, brackets, and bands of carvings and paintings. In addition to these components, it also has a large structure that was supposed to be a clock tower but never turned out to be. Alternatively, a tiny red light was put on it to alert the populace if the monarch was there.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Although the exteriors were the focus, the interiors are no less. The interiors are organized around two courtyards with trees and water fountains that quickly transport you to India&#8217;s tropical environment. The pleasant afternoons are provided by the trees and the water fountain, while the regal aspect is contributed by marble statues and cast-iron lamp posts. Aside from that, the interiors have been lavishly adorned with elaborate stucco work, paintings, foreign-made crystal chandeliers, stained glass windows, Venetian floor mosaics, exquisite furniture, and sculptures by Felici, the renowned Italian artist.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">This palace has enormous stairs with ornate marble railings and wide long hallways, much like any other palace. The palace is surrounded by these passageways, which give sufficient natural lighting and ventilation. The 170 large and tiny rooms are connected by magnificent stairways and long darkened hallways, some with themes such as the silver room or the gulabi (pink) room. The Darbar Hall is arguably the most remarkable of them, and without even viewing it, one cannot fully appreciate the palace&#8217;s magnificence.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>The Darbar Hall:</strong> This great hall, which is approximately 5000 Sq. Ft in size is where the most exquisite music and dance events, as well as the most extravagant feasts, were held. The juxtaposing golden decorations above the arches and the dark brown wooden balconies gazing down from the first floor provide vitality to the hall, which is painted in a pale ivory tone.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The intricate Venetian floor mosaic on the double-height hall&#8217;s floor contrasts with geometric designs in green and red on the ceiling. The bright belgian stained glass windows add to the overall effect. When the hall is lighted up with large crystal chandeliers echoing the hues of the ceilings and painting the space in a regal air, the entire design comes together.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>The Gaddi Hall:</strong> The Gaddi Hall is famous for housing the throne, which has been occupied by numerous monarchs in the past. An amazing number of beautiful artworks are stitched throughout the extremely huge space. The paintings of Goddess Saraswati, Laxmi, and Lord Krishna, among others, are meticulously placed to create a feeling of harmony and balance.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>The Pratap Shastragar:</strong> The Pratap Shastragar, or royal armoury, is located in a visitor-friendly section of the palace. The age-old weaponry that was previously used by the royal family and troops of the Baroda State Army are stored here, behind the enormous glass cases. The Rajratna Prof. Manikrao, the man who renovated the Jummadada Vyayam Mandir, selected this assortment.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>The Gardens:</strong> William Goldring, a landscape architect from Kew Gardens, manicured the gardens surrounding the palace. The Sunken Garden, located just outside the mansion, is the most famous of them. Human statues in marble and bronze, as well as decorative marble urns, are scattered around the gardens.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>The Gates:</strong> The primary and sole magnificent entrance to the palace is located at the end of the Rajmahal Road, among the many gates allowing access to the many parts of the mansion. The king/royal clan have their own gate, which is equally as impressive as the palace itself. This doorway, like the other gates found in Gaekwadi Era structures, has a centre section with a Bengali roof surrounded by two towers and two smaller entrances topped with domes. The structure is made of the same stone as the castle and is embellished with etchings of animals and ornate patterns.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>A model railway and a zoo:</strong> The mansion formerly had its own miniature railway and zoo. To transport his children from the school to the main Lakshmi Vilas Palace, the King built a small train line that encircled the mango grove within the palace grounds.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-surroundings-of-the-palace"><strong>The surroundings of the Palace</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>The Fatehsinhrao Museum: </strong>The Fatehsinhrao Museum was built as a schoolhouse for the king&#8217;s children. The museum now houses a vast collection of works of art belonging to the royal family. The most notable of these is the magnificent collection of Raja Ravi Varma&#8217;s paintings, which were particularly acquired by the Maharaja of Baroda.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The museum is well-known among the locals for hosting the yearly Fort Building Competition and the Ganpati Idol Making Competition, both of which are open to both adults and children.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>The Cricket Association and the Motibaug Palace:</strong> The Motibaug Palace is really a modest structure that precedes the mansion itself. It was originally built during Maharaja Ganpatrao Gaekwad&#8217;s era to accommodate the State&#8217;s architects and engineers. The Gaekwad Baroda Golf Club&#8217;s main club is now housed there. The Moti Bagh Cricket Ground, the administration of the Baroda Cricket Association, and a very unusual indoor teak coated tennis and badminton court are next to the Motibaug Palace and the Museum.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>The Golf Club:</strong> Maharaja Pratapsinhrao built a golf course for his European visitors in the 1930s. The course was rebuilt and offered to the general populace in the 1990s by Pratapsinhrao&#8217;s grandson Samarjitsinh, a renowned Ranji Trophy cricket player. The Gaekwad Baroda Golf Club upgraded the course in 2004 into a magnificent course that presently has over 900 members.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>The LVP Banquets:</strong> The LVP Banquets was established a few years ago with a tiny facility comprising of a few large and small halls. The sunken gardens, which are a part of the mansion, are also available for hire by the Banquets for arranging parties and ceremonies.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>A massive tree and an ecology: </strong>Over time, the gardens around the palace have acquired their own environment. Around the royal compound, langoors and peacocks may be seen in packs. Aside from that, the complex is home to a massive Banyan tree known as the &#8220;Sayaji Vad,&#8221; which is over a century old and has its own ecology.</p>



<h2 id="h-facts-about-lakshmi-vilas-palace"><strong>Facts about Lakshmi Vilas Palace</strong></h2>



<ol type="1"><li>Did you know that it is known to be the world&#8217;s largest private residence?</li></ol>



<ul><li>The interiors are reminiscent of a large European country house.</li></ul>



<ul><li>It had elevators when it was built, which was unusual.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Prem Rog released in 1982, Dil Hi Toh Hai released in 1993, Sardaar Gabbar Singh released in 2016, and Grand Masti released in 2013, are just a few of the Bollywood films shot in this palace.</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-valuation-of-vadodara-s-lakshmi-vilas-palace"><strong>Valuation of Vadodara&#8217;s Lakshmi Vilas Palace</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III constructed Lakshmi Vilas Palace in 1890 for a staggering ₹27,00,000 (£1,80,000), which was a considerable sum at that time. The Moti Bagh Cricket Ground, as well as the administration of the well-known Baroda Cricket Association are located near the museum. Navlakhi Vav, a famous stepwell dating from 1405 AD, is also included inside the complex. While it is nearly hard to correctly describe the value of such a massive and intimidating national landmark, estimations suggest that property values in this location might range from ₹7,000 to ₹8,000 per Sq. Ft. Taking all into consideration, it is worth noting that the palace compound covers 700 acres or 3,04,92,000 Sq. Ft. Using the current market cost of ₹8,000 per Sq. Ft as a guide, the ultimate worth would be at least ₹2,43,93,60,00,000. To put it another way, the Lakshmi Vilas Palace would be valued at a staggering twenty-four thousand three hundred and sixty crores and sixty lakhs. Given the structure&#8217;s cultural significance and history, this figure may potentially reach ₹25,000 crores.</p>



<h2 id="h-ending-remarks"><strong>Ending Remarks</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Overall, the palace is the pinnacle of grandeur and a testament of a king who used to be the world&#8217;s eighth richest man. The palace is one of the greatest examples of Indo-Saracenic architecture, which combines Hindu, Mughal, Rajasthani, and Western design. It is adorned with items by some of the world&#8217;s finest artisans. Last but not least, it is a depiction of the splendour of an Indian princely state. Picture the magnificence of India, which at one time had about 800 similar Princely States.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-justify">Mumbai has been branded as the city of dreams, India&#8217;s financial hub and entertainment capital, and the city that never sleeps. Luxurious apartments, posh localities, fine-dining establishments, state-of-the-art development, swanky entertainment zones, and glamorous retail malls surround the bustling metropolis city.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Mumbai, which is bordered by the Arabian Sea, is home to a slew of business tycoons, entrepreneurs, celebrities, cricketers, politicians, and other notable public figures. So, it&#8217;s only reasonable that the city of dreams has a plethora of opulent neighbourhoods. While low-income housing remains a challenge for many Mumbai citizens, the city also has a diverse range of affluent neighbourhoods.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">These areas are frequently distinguished by the presence of lavish amenities such as closeness to the sea, cutting-edge infrastructure, and so on. Do you intend to move to a new suburban Mumbai residential area? Or are you a first-time visitor to Mumbai who wants to see the magic and aura of the city?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In any event, visiting Mumbai&#8217;s most lush localities is highly advised. Take a glance at our top recommendations of the top expensive areas of Mumbai.</p>



<h2 id="h-malabar-hill-most-expensive-area-in-mumbai"><strong>Malabar Hill: Most Expensive Area in Mumbai</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Malabar Hill is one of Mumbai&#8217;s most upscale areas, located atop a hilltop in South Mumbai. The Girgaon Chowpatty Beach, Back Bay, and Nariman Point are all within walking distance of most residences in this region, which provide unobstructed views of the Mumbai skyline.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">This is one of the primary causes behind Malabar Hill&#8217;s exorbitant real estate costs. It is well recognized for housing several notable government officials&#8217; private homes.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Raj Bhavan, Maharashtra&#8217;s Governor&#8217;s official estate, and Varsha Bungalow-Maharashtra&#8217;s Chief Minister&#8217;s house, all are located on Malabar Hill.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Pallonji Mistry, the Petit family, the Jindal family, Adi Godrej, and Shashi Ruia are among the numerous corporate moguls that call this posh locality their home. The Hanging Gardens, Jain Temple, and Banganga Tank are among Malabar Hill&#8217;s other renowned landmarks.</p>



<p>The average price of a residence in Malabar Hill is ₹51,500 per square foot.</p>



<h2 id="h-worli-the-heart-of-mumbai"><strong>Worli: The Heart of Mumbai</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Worli is among the seven islands that make up modern-day Mumbai. It was once a fishing town. It has been turned into an urban residential hotspot owing to its strategic position and world-class facilities.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">It also links the Bandra Kurla Complex and Nariman Point, two of Mumbai&#8217;s most prominent business districts. As a result, Worli has become one of Mumbai&#8217;s most premium suburbs.</p>



<p>The magnificent Bandra-Worli Sea Link, which opened in 2009, has added to Worli&#8217;s skyrocketing land values.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Worli is now considerably more accessible thanks to the bridge that links it to Bandra, Mumbai&#8217;s western district. Worli is home to a number of famous entrepreneurs, including Narayan Murthy, Anil Agarwal, Nandan Nilekani, Anand Piramal, and Isha Ambani.</p>



<p>Retail stores, eateries, nightclubs, and other commercial enterprises dominate the neighbourhood, making it one of the most popular recreational spots for working professionals on the island metropolis.</p>



<p>The average price of a residence in Worli is ₹37,013 per square foot.</p>

It is also home to Antilla, which is India&#8217;s most valuable private property, Tardeo contains a variety of commercial buildings, including educational and healthcare facilities. Because there are limited residential possibilities in the region, it is one of Mumbai&#8217;s most pricey locations.</p>



<p>The average price of a residence in Tardeo is ₹47,786 per square foot.</p>



<h2 id="h-juhu-beverly-hills-of-bollywood"><strong>Juhu: Beverly Hills of Bollywood</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">When a residential area is affectionately dubbed as the &#8220;Beverly Hills of Bollywood,&#8221; you know it&#8217;s upscale. Juhu, which is bordered on the west by the Arabian Sea, is host to Bollywood&#8217;s most well-known stars.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The bungalows of renowned cinema actors like Amitabh Bachchan, Hema Malini, Akshay Kumar, Shahid Kapoor, and others may be found here. Jalsa, Amitabh Bachchan&#8217;s home, continues to attract a crowd of cinema fans from all across the country.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">As a result, Juhu is one of Mumbai&#8217;s most expensive neighbourhoods. There are also a number of prominent educational institutes as well as vibrant cafés.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Apart from being home to a slew of Bollywood royalty, Juhu is famous for its beautiful beach. JW Marriott, Prithvi Theatre, The Orchid Hotel, and ISKCON Temple are among the other main landmarks. The Juhu Chowpatty, where street food sellers set up their shops in the evening, is also well-known in the neighbourhood.</p>



<p>Juhu is therefore both an affluent suburb and a popular tourist destination in Mumbai.</p>



<p>The average price of a residence in Juhu is ₹44,442 per square foot.</p>



<h2 id="h-bandra-posh-localities-of-mumbai"><strong>Bandra: Posh Localities of Mumbai</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">Bandra, popularly referred to as the Queen of Suburbs, is home to a plethora of fancy diners, bars, and cafés. Hill Road and Linking Road in Bandra are also home to Mumbai&#8217;s iconic clothing stores.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Bandra, similar to other affluent localities in Mumbai is home to a slew of Bollywood stars, sportsmen, and politicians. Mannat, Shah Rukh Khan&#8217;s Lands End house, is one of Bandra&#8217;s most renowned tourist destinations. Galaxy Towers, Salman Khan&#8217;s mansion, is also only around a mile away.</p>



<p>The average price of a residence in Bandra is ₹42,691 per square foot.</p>

<ul><li>Billionaire investor and founder of D-Mart, Radhakishan Damani buys a luxe bungalow in south Mumbai’s Malabar Hill locale for worth&nbsp; ₹1,001 crores.</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-why-such-skyrocket-prices-in-mumbai"><strong>Why Such Skyrocket Prices in Mumbai?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Almost every week, there is news of a big-ticket real estate investment in Mumbai. It does rounds on the Internet when a business tycoon or Bollywood celebrity buys an apartment or building for a very high sum. Mumbai is consistently ranked one of the most expensive places to buy property.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Price is defined by the relationship of demand and supply, as most of us are aware. The greater the cost, the lesser the supply. Likewise, when demand increases, so does the cost.</p>



<h2 id="h-so-what-are-the-causes-that-are-reducing-property-supply-and-raising-demand-in-mumbai"><strong>So, what are the causes that are reducing property supply and raising demand in Mumbai?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Government Policy:</strong> Another aspect is government policy. Circle rates, set by the government, determine not just the minimum stamp duty but also the starting price. Mumbai&#8217;s prices have gone up by upto 20% in past years, which is significantly higher than the rest of the nation.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Rent Control:</strong> Rent regulation has an impact on real estate supply since a significant proportion of renters, particularly in the city&#8217;s best locations, may live on monthly rates of less than 500 rupees. Because landowners are not allowed to raise this rent due to government price controls, the burden on non-rent-controlled properties to generate taxes is considerably greater.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Inward Migration:</strong> For years, Mumbai has undoubtedly been India&#8217;s business hub. Mumbai has opportunities for everyone, from white-collar occupations to basic labour sustaining the wealthy&#8217;s lives. However, this inflow of migrants puts strain on the city to provide housing. <strong>Investment Buyers:</strong> A type of purchaser branded as &#8220;investment buyers&#8221; – individuals who have no intention of living in Mumbai but want to purchase real estate there in the hopes of profiting later – is also creating too much demand. These purchasers, who are mostly non-resident Indians or individuals with significant sums of unregulated money, add to the already massive demand.</p>

As per the latest report by Square Yards tilted “List of Most Expensive Homes Sold in Mumbai- Jan-June 2021”, several transactions worth Rs 15 to 100 Crore were registered in the city during the first half of the year. The approximate value of these transactions were pegged at around Rs 4600 Crore.</p>



<p>It was clear that the surge in home sales in the city was driven by the stamp duty waiver which was valid till 31<sup>st</sup> March 2021. Nearly 60% of the total transactions captured for the homes priced above Rs 15 Crore during this period were registered at a 2% stamp duty. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The list of high-net worth individuals who bought these uber-luxury homes included prominent names such as <a href="https://www.squareyards.com/blog/amitabh-bachchan-house-and-properties" class="ek-link">Amitabh Bachchan</a>, Sunny Leone, Cabinet Minister Ashok Chavan, Smita Parekh, wife of HDFC Chairman, Deepak Parekh etc.</p>



<p><strong>Key Highlights of the Report</strong></p>



<ul><li>More than <strong>85%</strong> of the homes purchased with a Rs 15 Crore+ price tag were priced between<br>Rs 15-30 Crore. Out of these more than <strong>35%</strong> were priced between Rs 20-30 Crore.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Nearly <strong>60%</strong> of the total transactions captured came from residential projects in Lower Parel.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>60%</strong> of the total transactions were made at <strong>2%</strong> stamp duty indicating that the slashed stamp duty charges spurred a major uptick in the luxury segment in Q1, 2021.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Higher floors were more preferred by luxury property buyers as <strong>34% </strong>of the transactions recorded were for units on the <strong>40<sup>th</sup></strong> and above floors.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Maximum number of transactions were noted for properties sized between <strong>4,000-6,000 Sq.Ft</strong>. with <strong>43%</strong> share of the total sales.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Almost <strong>67%</strong> of the buyers in the list were aged above <strong>40 years</strong> while <strong>35%</strong> of the buyers belonged to the real estate sector.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify">Square Yards, the country’s foremost integrated real estate platform, based in Gurugram, has raised $25 million or approximately Rs. 185 crore from global investment manager ADM Capital which currently has $2.4 billion of assets under management throughout Europe and the Asia Pacific. This new infusion of growth capital is the first tranche of Square Yards’ ongoing goals of raising more than $100 million in capital in the near future. The company will be using this capital to continue expansion and investments in several verticals throughout the entire value chain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Founder &amp; CEO at Square Yards, Tanuj Shori, stated that Square Yard has been mostly capital efficient from inception with a clear emphasis on ensuring higher ROI. The company has met important operational benchmarks over the last year including profitability and also the pilot success of its new ventures like home interiors, property management and rentals among others. He added that Square Yards is now at the cusp of accelerating further growth while adding that with a stronger institutional partner such as ADM Capital, the company can push forward aggressively towards accomplishing both personal and brand investments with a view towards ensuring a swifter growth trajectory.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Square Yards is already developing an integrated service ecosystem both inorganically and organically. It acquired platform capabilities recently in data intelligence, VR and property management/rentals while launching a full service platform that offers home interior and home furnishing solutions. The Co-Founding Partner and Joint Chief Investment Officer, ADM Capital, Christopher Botsford, stated that they are happy to back Square Yards in its future growth pursuits and will continue looking for more opportunities to support leading Indian corporates who are aiming at disrupting conventional industries. He added that the company is also happy with the willingness of Square Yards to scale up its social and environmental policies and can share expertise, taking ADM Capital’s proven capabilities of enhancing borrower governance and mitigation of ESG risks into account.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">ADM Capital was founded in 1998, offering flexible credit options to top midsized corporates in the Asia Pacific. ADM Capital forayed into the Indian market around 2004 and has since deployed more than $670 million throughout 18 private financings. ADM Capital emphasizes greatly on stronger corporate governance and social and environmental compliance alike. Integrated strategies have been influencing the proptech space globally and top entities like Compass, Zillow and Beike are building digital integrated consumer experiences spanning all transactional aspects involving the buy-and-sell part, helping them capture a bigger slice of the entire transaction. Square Yards has been pioneering an integrated ecosystem based model and is one of the few global realty platforms that provide the entire full stack digital realty journey encompassing transactions, search and discovery, home interiors, mortgages, property management, rentals and after-sales services. Square Yards also provides B2B SaaS solutions for real estate developers, banks, realty agents and financial institutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-justify">Understanding the technical jargon used by real estate brokers is critical for potential homebuyers to prevent mistakes that might jeopardize their chances of acquiring the house of their dreams. In India, developers and agents frequently use the words carpet area, built-up area, and super built-up area, prompting many people to search for explanations on the internet. In reality, some fraudulent companies have taken advantage of customers&#8217; lack of information by demanding greater costs. As a result, it is critical that you complete your study before speaking with your agent again.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Square Yards explains the distinctions between the carpet area, built-up area, and super built-up area, three widely used terminologies:</p>



<h2 id="h-carpet-area">Carpet Area</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">A carpet area is an area that may be covered by a carpet, as the name suggests. The actual usable floor space of a house is determined by the distance between walls. Builders are required by RERA (Real Estate Regulation and Development Act) rules to reveal the carpet area of each unit upon which the selling price must be determined. This space does not include the area occupied by the exterior walls, balcony, or terrace, unlike the built-up area described below. The carpet area, which becomes your personal space, however, comprises the thickness of the house&#8217;s interior walls.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The carpet area covers roughly 70% of the built-up area, which includes the living area, bedrooms, and other rooms, the kitchen and baths, and, on some occasions, even the interior stairway. Assuming you have a built-up space of 1,000 square feet, the carpet area will be 70% of 1,000 square feet or 700 square feet.</p>



<h2 id="h-calculate-the-carpet-area-using-this-formula">Calculate the carpet area using this formula</h2>



<p>Carpet area = bedroom + living area + balconies + toilets – inner wall thickness</p>



<h2 id="h-how-can-you-make-sure-you-do-not-get-misled-when-it-comes-to-the-carpet-area">How can you make sure you do not get misled when it comes to the carpet area?</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">If you are purchasing a project in a large housing society, the developer is required by the RERA to disclose the carpet area of the unit. However, you need to hire a technical expert to come to the apartment and measure the space. If you apply for a mortgage, the bank will send a technical expert to inspect the property. Check with them to see whether the carpet area that the developer told you about is the same as what they estimated. If there are any inconsistencies, you should notify the developer and renegotiate the price.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Another important point to keep in mind when buying a home is not to be carried away by the built-up or super-built-up area figures if the carpet area is not as per your preference. At the end of the day, the carpet area is the area that you will use in your everyday life. Ascertain that the three figures are perfectly balanced, with the carpet area taking the lead.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-few-other-things-to-keep-in-mind">A few other things to keep in mind</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">While developers are now legally required to disclose the carpet area when measuring and pricing flats, provisions have been created for the measurement to be increased or decreased while a project is under construction. If the carpet area is lowered during construction, the developer is required to repay the extra cost to the customer within 45 days, plus yearly interest. If the carpet area is increased, the developer may require the buyer to pay the difference. The RERA, on the other hand, stipulates that the increase in carpet area cannot exceed 3%.</p>



<h2 id="h-built-up-area">Built-up Area</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The built-up area is the total size of the residential unit, which includes the carpet area as well as the thickness of the walls. This includes the area covered by the balcony or terrace. It usually accounts for roughly 70 to 80 percent of the estate&#8217;s super built-up area. It should be remembered that the proportion may differ depending on the project or builder. The built-up area, on the other hand, is created by adding 10 to 15% more room to the carpet area. Assuming a super built-up area of 1,200 square feet, the built-up area will be 70% or 80% of 1,200 square feet, or 840 square feet or 960 square feet, respectively, while the carpet area will be 588 square feet or 672 square feet.</p>



<h3 id="h-calculate-the-built-up-area-using-this-formula">Calculate the built-up area using this formula</h3>



<p>Built-up area = carpet area + wall area + balcony area</p>



<h3 id="h-carpet-area-vs-built-up-area-what-is-the-difference">Carpet Area vs Built-up Area: What is the difference?</h3>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Carpet area refers to the space that may be covered by a carpet, whereas built-up area refers to the area that remains after the carpet.</p>



<h2 id="h-super-built-up-area">Super Built-up Area</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The super built-up area is the total of the built-up area plus the space used by common spaces such as the lobby, stairwell, lift, shafts, and clubhouse, among other things. Developers frequently charge consumers depending on this area to recoup their building costs. As a result, it is known as the &#8220;saleable&#8221; area. The loading factor, which is the proportionate share of the common space in a flat derived by multiplying the carpet area by a multiplier (1.25), is closely linked to the super built-up area. This equates to a 25% or 30% increase in total saleable area. The difference between the super built-up area and the carpet area is used to calculate its value. The loading factor is used by many builders to determine the pricing of a unit.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Developers frequently utilized the super-built-up area as the space-measuring unit before the RERA made it necessary for them to sell apartments based on carpet area, to take advantage of the lack of clarity on space computation. They were able to reduce the properties per Sq. Ft cost by using a super built-up area as the measurement unit. It also gave the customer the idea that they were purchasing a huge home when they weren&#8217;t.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Since it becomes a benchmark for builders to charge their customers, the super built-up area is also known as the saleable area,” says Vijay Verma, CEO, Sunworld Group. The computation of a super built-up area is done differently when there is more than one unit on a level, he says.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Assume a residence with a carpet area of 1,000 square feet that costs ₹2,000 per square foot. The total cost of the property, in this case, will be ₹20,00,000. A builder will give the super built-up area (let&#8217;s say, 1,300 sq. ft) and price the home cheaper at, say, ₹1,800 per Sq. Ft to make the marketing pitch even more appealing. In this case, the property&#8217;s total price will be ₹23.40 lakhs. The latter would sound far more appealing to an uninformed consumer than the former.</p>



<h3 id="h-calculate-the-super-built-up-area-using-this-formula">Calculate the super built-up area using this formula</h3>



<p><strong>Built-up area + proportional common area = super built-up area.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Or</strong></p>



<p><strong>Carpet&nbsp;area (1+loading factor) = Super built-up area</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Remember:</strong> Based on the developer and the specific location, the loading might be anywhere from 15 to 50 percent.</p>



<h3 id="h-example-of-calculating-the-super-built-up-area"><strong>Example of calculating the super built-up area</strong></h3>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The super built-up area is computed differently when there are many units on a floor.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Suppose Rahul Patel owns a flat with a built-up area of 1,000 Sq. Ft on the fifth level of a housing society. Arun Prasad has a flat on the same level with a built-up area of 2,000 square feet. The floor&#8217;s entire common area is 1,500 square feet.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">To calculate the super built-up area of the two flats the developer would split the built-up areas of the two flats by their ratio (in this example 1:2), then add 500 square feet to Patel&#8217;s total built-up area and 1,000 square feet to Prasad&#8217;s built-up area. Patel&#8217;s flat now has a super built-up size of 1,500 Sq. Ft, whereas Prasad&#8217;s has a super built-up area of 3,000 square feet.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-purchasers-refuse-to-pay-for-a-developer-s-increase-in-carpet-area"><strong>Can purchasers refuse to pay for a developer&#8217;s increase in carpet area?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Due to revisions in the plan and an increase in the carpet area, the developer has increased the overall price of the house on several occasions. The purchaser is responsible for the additional charges under RERA&#8217;s terms. In a case brought by Ashley Neil Serrao and Mark Clement Serrao, who had acquired a property in Runwal Greens by Propel Developers Pvt Ltd, the Maharashtra RERA has openly stated that the purchaser is responsible for paying the extra money.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-determine-the-area-of-your-future-home-s-usable-space"><strong>How to determine the area of your future home&#8217;s usable space?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Always inquire about the carpet area of the apartment and base your price negotiations on this figure. You could seek the assistance of a private technical assessor to re-confirm the carpet area in the apartment so that there is no room for any deception. Those who purchase a home with the aid of housing financing are in a stronger position since the bank will send its own legal and technical assessors to inspect the property&#8217;s specifications.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Another thing to keep in mind is that even if a developer quotes the price of a home-based on carpet area, they will almost always increase per Sq. Ft cost to account for the built-up and super built-up areas. Try to find out how much similar projects in the region cost to see whether the amount your builder offered is reasonable. If not, the buyer has the option of negotiating the agreement and attempting to lower the pricing.</p>



<h2 id="h-few-more-terms"><strong>Few More Terms</strong></h2>



<h3 id="h-noc-no-objection-certificate"><strong>NOC (No Objection Certificate)</strong></h3>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">A no objection certificate is a legal document that states that an individual or corporation has been granted authorization to purchase or build real estate.</p>



<h3 id="h-occupancy-certificate-oc"><strong>Occupancy certificate (OC)</strong></h3>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The occupancy certificate is a crucial document that verifies that the building was built according to the approved designs and in accordance with local regulations. After verifying that all local laws have been followed, the local municipal corporation releases this document. The occupancy certificate must be obtained by the developer. When offering loans to property buyers, many financial firms require an occupancy certificate.</p>



<h3 id="h-completion-certificate-cc"><strong>Completion certificate (CC)</strong></h3>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">A completion certification is a legal document that certifies that a new building has been erected and completed in accordance with the Buildings Act&#8217;s safety standards and regulations, as well as municipal legislation.</p>



<h2 id="h-haryana-rera-has-issued-laws-requiring-flats-to-be-sold-only-based-on-carpet-area"><strong>Haryana (RERA) has issued laws requiring flats to be sold only based on carpet area</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">On April 27, 2021, the Haryana Real Estate Regulatory Authority (HARERA) announced that developers can only offer flats in their developments based on carpet area. The state RERA declared that the selling of apartments on a super area or any other bench would be considered deceptive and an unfair commercial activity, and that developers who violated these instructions would face penalties. “In real estate developments, the property is not correctly represented by stating the super area without precisely describing and breaking down the components contained in the super area. “The practice of selling real estate on a super area basis is deceptive, imprecise, opaque, and leads to misunderstanding and difficulties, as well as unnecessary litigation,” stated KK Khandelwal, chairman of Haryana RERA.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-does-a-bhk-stand-for"><strong>What does a BHK stand for?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">BHK is an abbreviation for bedroom, hall, and kitchen. It is used to communicate the number of bedrooms and other arrangements in a flat/property. BHK is utilized in the real estate division pretty frequently. It is simply a Bedroom, Hall, and Kitchen&#8217;s short-form like below:</p>



<p>B = Bedroom<br>H = Hall<br>K = Kitchen</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Nowadays real estate market has classified/categorized all studios/flats as 1BHK, 2 BHK, 3 BHK, etc. like the following:</p>



<p>1BHK is 1 bedroom, hall, and kitchen<br>2BHK is 2 bedrooms, hall, and kitchen<br>3BHK is 3 bedrooms, hall, and kitchen<br>4BHK is 4 bedrooms, hall, and kitchen</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">When a person addresses a specific flat of an apartment as 1 BHK, the person is explaining that the flat/apartment has 1 Bedroom, 1 Hall, and 1 Kitchen respectively. Likewise, if a person labels a 2 BHK, the person is representing about 2 Bedrooms, 1 Hall, 1 Kitchen, and 3 Bedrooms, 1 Hall, 1 Kitchen each.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">A 3BHK arrangement indicates a flat pattern that has three bedrooms, one hall, and one kitchen in the apartment/flat.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-1rk"><strong>What is 1RK?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">1RK indicates just one room that connects a bedroom, washroom, and kitchen. There are apartments on old-type constructions with the most extensive carpet area where 1RK is transformed into 1BHK by segregating.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">As the full form implies, RK is Room and Kitchen. For instance, a 2 BHK, for the economy in property language, is associated with a 2 Bedroom Hall Kitchen. An RK has a room, washroom, and kitchen so it does not possess any complete wall divider to separate the house and it simply looks similar to a big room.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-a-penthouse"><strong>What is a penthouse?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">A penthouse is a leisure apartment that is placed on the best, top-most floor of the arrangement. These flats have magnificent views of the horizon and the view gives a feeling of greatness to the inhabitants. The word ‘penthouse’ is basically referred to a smaller ‘house’ that was built on the rooftop of a building. Balconies and rooftop levels are the remarkable high point of penthouse flats/apartments.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-a-studio-apartment"><strong>What is a studio apartment?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">A studio apartment is a tiny apartment that connects several rooms, usually the hall, bedroom, and kitchen. These types of apartments regularly include one large room that usually works as the living, dining, and bedroom or may consist of a pretty small pad for a bedroom. The kitchen equipment may be placed in the middle room, or a tiny separate room, and the washroom is normally in a tiny space.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The studio flat is an apartment with only one room. These apartments are also recognized as single-room residence rooms or studio apartments. They are also introduced as Efficiency Flats.</p>



<h2 id="h-difference-between-1bhk-and-1rk"><strong>Difference between 1Bhk And 1RK</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The fundamental difference between 1Bhk And 1RK is that the hall is not present. One BHK is ideal for tiny and lower-middle-income families because it consists of a room, a hall, and an individual kitchen so the people will eventually turn the hall into a different room where the kids of the family can grow up. But in a 1RK, only a room and an individual kitchen are present with the absence of a hall that could be transformed into a different room for children, so it could be valid solely for the bachelors.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-justify">The very concept of Vastu Shastra came forward during the Vedic times in India, that is the science of space and architecture that guides the people to create spaces and environment that supports their physical, mental and spiritual health and paves the way for a prosperous life. Vastu Shastra is regarded as the science of designing and building houses, offices, temples, and other living spaces. Since ancient times, energy has been considered a free-flowing creation that can neither be created nor destroyed.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">&nbsp;The transformation from one form to the other is possible. This free-flowing energy directs all the positive or negative vibes and thoughts within ourselves and our surroundings. Following the sets of rules and regulations of Vastu before entering any new place is mandatory to live a healthy and peaceful life.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Referring to our auspicious Mythology and Vedas, Vastu Shastra indicates the directions- East and North to be most blessed with positive energies; hence, North-facing homes are the most auspicious ones.<strong> Vastu Shastra for North Facing Homes </strong>is widely accepted because of the presence of Lord Kuber, also known as the God of Wealth, in the North direction. It is not only the north-facing home that brings in prosperity but the whole North-facing house planin which every direction should be planned as per the Vastu. North Facing Home Vastu includes a complete list of directions for different corners of the house that needs to be followed to attract good positive energies. The list is as follows:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Master Bedroom:</strong> Should face South-west region</li><li><strong>Pooja Room:</strong> Should be located in North-east region</li><li><strong>Living Room:</strong> Should face North-east region</li><li><strong>Guest Room:</strong> Should be in the North-west region</li><li><strong>Kitchen:</strong> Should lie in the South-east or North-west direction.</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-about-north-facing-home"><strong>About North Facing Home</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Briefly describing since the existence of humans, directions have played an essential role in assisting where, what and when to hunt, hide and migrate. Era&#8217;s changed, but directions still play a significant role in defining wealth and prosperity in human life; hence, the main entry gate of any house situated in the north direction is considered as North Facing Home that accounts for most positive energies.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-north-facing-homes-good-or-bad"><strong>Are North Facing Homes Good or Bad?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">It would not be fitting to conclude that only <strong>North Facing House Plans</strong> are the most appropriate and good ones, and the rest of the directions are not; rather, all the directions have their specialty, no direction is good or bad. People need to follow specific guidelines of <strong>Vastu Shastra for North Facing Homes </strong>to attract prosperity to their homes.</p>



<h2 id="h-location-of-main-gate-in-north-facing-house-plan"><strong>Location of Main Gate in North Facing House Plan</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In any house plan, there is always a special emphasis on the location of the main gate because it is the entrance point of the home from where either all negative or all the positive forces will enter the home. Hence its placement is the major area of concern. So, in a<strong> North Facing House Plan</strong>, the main gate should only be located in the North direction, the distance between north-east and north-west is divided into nine equal parts, where also the fifth step is the most auspicious among all because of the belief of the existence of God of Wealth there.</p>

<h2 id="h-importance-of-padas-in-vastu-shastra"><strong>Importance of Padas in Vastu Shastra</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">According to the Vastu Shastra, a north-facing home is the most auspicious location as no pada situated in this direction is considered inauspicious. But to attract prosperity and well-being of the family members, people should follow the following tips:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">As stated above, the fifth pada is considered the most auspicious among all the nine padas because of the presence of the Lord of wealth Kuber and determines the entrance of all the flow of energy in the house. Therefore, the main gate should always be placed in the fifth pada to attract wealth and prosperity to your home.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-any-alternative-for-placing-the-main-door-at-the-fifth-pada"><strong>Is there any alternative for placing the main door at the fifth pada?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In Vastu Shastra, it is advised that if due to any circumstances like size issue or anything else, the individual cannot place the main gate at fifth pada, then they may utilize first to the fourth pada particularly, and should not leave the fifth one. In some cases, if there is no choice to place the main door from first to the fifth pada, people may use sixth to the ninth pada to place the door.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Caution: </strong>It is advised that, due to the unavailability of any other pada for placement of the door, any individual tends to place the door at the fifth pada, they are advised to leave some space from the north-east corner. The door must not touch this corner under any circumstances.<strong></strong></p>

<h2 id="h-conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Since our great mythologies, i.e., Mahabharata and Ramayana that are believed to have existed almost 3000-5000 years ago, the existence and belief in Vastu Shastra also came into power, which cannot be neglected at any cost. When things are placed according to the Vastu, good vibes, energy, and health are attracted, and if not, then many unimaginable, bad things do happen. So, one must always consult Vastu before buying any property and after shifting to a new property. According to Vastu Shastra, no direction is good or bad. Still, a north-facing property is considered most auspicious due to the belief of Lord Kuber. For any doshas, in the rest of the directions, many Vastu doshas tips are also there that help to attract positive energies in non-north-facing properties too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-justify">West-facing residences are considered unlucky due to preconceived notions. Vastu experts tell us how to take advantage of the power of west-facing homes to make them more profitable for homeowners. Home purchasers may make unusual decisions to bring prosperity and positive energy into their homes. Some people, for instance, may only desire an east-facing residence, north-facing bedrooms, or perhaps an east-facing kid&#8217;s room.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In truth, west-facing residences are less desirable due to a prevalent misunderstanding that they are unfortunate and inauspicious. According to experts of Vastu Shastra for west-facing homes, all angles are equal yet come with specific restrictions that one should be aware of for positivity to flow freely in the home.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Even if a lovely west-facing house is available, numerous real estate brokers or lucrative property advertising will try to persuade you to buy other properties. They frequently advertise such homes at a significantly higher price, claiming that they are in high demand. It is fairly unusual for people to believe and propagate rumours that a west-facing home brings bad luck and should be avoided. On the flip side, the reality is quite different than it actually is. Nevertheless, Square Yards is here to burst these misconceptions.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">According to Indian Vastu gurus, each direction has its meaning and is equally fortunate. So, ensure that the property is Vastu compliant. It will help you and your family have a happy and wealthy life ahead. Today, we will dig deep into the significance of the Vastu designs for west-facing homes. So, stay connected with us as we investigate why you should not dismiss a magnificent west-facing house just based on misconceptions and rumours. So, let&#8217;s get started.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-a-west-facing-house">What is a West-facing house?</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">A residence or apartment is termed west-facing if the main entrance faces west. Normally, west-facing residences are not considered auspicious, but Vastu experts disagree. West-facing residences&#8217; main entrances should be somewhat to the north-west or in the center. When it comes to the main door, the southwest approach should be avoided at all costs.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The 5th and 6th pada will be the finest for the main door if you split the lengths from the northwest angle to the west corner into nine equal sections or pada, with the first in one in the west and the ninth one in the southwest. The seventh, eighth, as well as ninth padas should not be used for the entry since they are regarded as the devil&#8217;s energy corner.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Nevertheless, as per Vastu Shastra, all dwellings are regarded equally auspicious. Therefore west-facing homes are no less fortunate than north or east-facing ones. If certain Vastu Shastra principles are followed, a west-facing home can be as wealthy as other dwellings. In this blog, we will look at the benefits of choosing a west-facing apartment as well as the Vastu principles to follow while building a west-facing home.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">According to the real convictions of the intellectual movement of Vastu Shastra, all dwellings, whether they are north, east, west, as well as south-facing, are regarded equally fortunate if they are built according to Vastu Shastra design concepts. According to Vastu Shastra, the orientation of the dwelling has no bearing. It all depends on where the house&#8217;s primary entrance or door is located.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-any-benefit">Is there any benefit?</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Homes with west-facing doors, however, according to Japanese house design principles, exude youth and enthusiasm. West-facing doors are said to let more energy into the dwelling. As a result, all traditional Geisha residences in Japan have their main entrance facing west. Folks who reside in west-facing residences are seen to be affluent and have a large social circle. They will have no adversaries and will be adored by everyone at work, relationships, and social contexts. Lawmakers, teachers, religious figures, and entrepreneurs benefit from living in residences with a west-facing orientation.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The kids&#8217; room in a west-facing house might be located on the south or western side, while the guest room can be located on the northwest. However, according to Vastu, the pooja room and sitting room should be at the northeast quadrant of the home, as it is the most fortunate corner.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The main bedroom should be oriented to the southwest. Your master bedroom must be on the upper floor of a multi-level home. Choose the east side for your kitchen. According to Vastu, the kitchen must not be placed immediately under or above the pooja room, bedrooms, or toilet.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The main benefit of a west-facing home is that you can enjoy the brightness and brilliance of the setting sun until dusk. Some people believe that a home facing the west will bring them more prosperity and fortune. They will have no adversaries and will be popular at work and also in social situations. Politicians, business entrepreneurs, teachers, and spiritual figures are said to prefer residences with a west-facing orientation. It is also said to be beneficial to children since it provides them with energy and happiness.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">You may have noticed that having a house that faces west or north is unattractive or brings bad omen, and so on. But much like any other property, you may employ Vastu principles to make a west-facing house fortunate. The west is not considered an unfavourable direction in Vastu Shastra. In fact, according to Vastu Shastra, any orientation is excellent for a home. However, the position of the entry or main door is the determining element in Vastu for your property.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">There is a popular misconception that west-facing dwellings are Vastu-defying, but this isn&#8217;t true. West-facing houses rank below north-and east-facing buildings in terms of auspiciousness, but they are not unlucky. In fact, Vastu principles claim that the West-facing homes offer profits and financial and non-financial advantages.</p>



<h2 id="h-vastu-tips-for-your-west-facing-house">Vastu Tips for your West-facing House</h2>



<ul><li>As per Vastu Shastra, it is critical for homeowners developing or purchasing new homes to establish a clear door situated within the appropriate &#8216;padas&#8217; or steps. The number of padas is calculated by dividing the house into nine equal sections, starting at the northwest corner, and working southward. In west-facing residences, the fourth, third, fifth, and sixth padas are the most auspicious for main entrances because they bring optimism and pleasant feelings. If the earlier in this thread padas are unavailable, the main door might be placed on padas one and two, which are neither excellent nor bad.</li><li>The kitchen is the main house engine and a source of good health and happiness for everyone who lives there. Therefore, Vastu adherents must construct their kitchens in the proper orientation. The kitchen should be in the eastern part or southeast part of the home, according to Vastu shastra. It is claimed that doing so guarantees that a kitchen&#8217;s positive charm is at its peak.</li><li>According to Vastu principles, the master bedroom should be in the house&#8217;s southern part. As a result, if the property has more than one story, the master bedroom should preferably be on the top floor. For bedrooms, there is a greater variety of direction options. As a result, they can be placed on the building&#8217;s south, west, or western most sides. It is preferable to have your master bedroom on the southwest side of the house. This orientation helps in increasing communication between couples in the room. If you have a multi-story home, the master bedroom should be on the top floor. This would bring prosperity, peace, and ancestral benefits to your household.</li><li>According to Vastu principles, private pools, storage tanks, and water submersible pumps should not be erected towards the west. Open areas should be located on the Eastern side of the building, away from the Western direction.</li><li>Colors like white, silvery, yellowish, and beige are most suited for west-facing houses, as per Vastu principles. Furthermore, it is claimed that these colours increase earnings and benefits from the Western direction. On the other hand, the home is oriented more towards the West than other directions, a lighter shade of blue can be employed to take advantage of the direction&#8217;s advantages. Off-white as well as creams are Vastu-neutral colors, making them safe choices when faced with a color palette.</li><li>Make sure your primary door entry is in the Midwest or Northwest corner of your house. Metalwork, such as a metallic name board or a metallic bell should be designed for your west-facing entrance. Maintain a detritus main entry area. Remove any trash cans or damaged furniture from the area around the entrance door.</li><li>The first and best step is to establish whether you have a property that faces west. Determining the same might be difficult because many people believe that the setting sun is in the west. The precise west direction, on the other hand, fluctuates year to year. You can establish the precise west side in only two days every year.</li><li>The temple, also known as a pooja room, is a sacred space where you may harness all of the divine forces surrounding you. The northeast direction is the most energetic zone in a west-facing home; therefore, it makes complete sense to put it in this corner. However, not every home has the necessary space to have a separate pooja room. If your lounge room does not have enough space for this, you can position your living room inside the north and a tiny temple or pooja stand inside the north part.</li><li>While verifying the directional face of the property, use a magnetic compass to trace the precise west.</li><li>Make sure the current house&#8217;s main entrance is only in the third or fourth padas.</li><li>Build the walls mainly on the south and west sides of the building- a bit thicker and taller than those on the east and north sides.</li><li>Place your living room as well as the Pooja room at the northeast corner of the house, as this is the most auspicious part of the house.</li><li>If you don&#8217;t have a pooja room, install the temple inside the living room&#8217;s north part.</li><li>Make sure the kid&#8217;s room is facing either west, south, or north-west.</li><li>If your plot is slanted, ensure that it is slanted from south to north.</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-things-you-must-avoid">Things you must avoid</h2>



<ul><li>Avoid using the setting sun to discover the precise west direction.</li><li>Except for the ones listed, avoid all other padas unless you visit a Vastu specialist beforehand.</li><li>Avoid buying land with a north-to-south slope since it may result in financial losses.</li><li>Avoid buying a parcel of land or a house with a southwest or south direction expansion.</li><li>A bore well, a storage tank or a sump should not be located in the southwest corner of a west-facing residence.</li><li>A kitchen should not be placed in the house&#8217;s southwest corner.</li><li>Sleeping beneath a beam or a wall divider is not a good idea.</li><li>Make sure your legs aren&#8217;t pointed towards the bedroom door as you sleep.</li><li>Purchase a property with a South and West border that is thinner than the East and North boundaries.</li><li>Avoid any home with the main entrance blocked by a huge item such as a tree or an electric pole.</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">As can be seen, the Vastu of west facing property is just as excellent as any other Vastu. All you have to do now is make sure you follow all of the Vastu regulations. If you are building a house on a plot, it is rather simple. However, if you are moving to a flat or apartment, you may face several difficulties. It is frequently impossible to carry out a remodel that necessitates structural changes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: 400">Residential real estate sales figures were steady between January and March, 2021 although they fell in the quarter between April and June, with the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic leading to countrywide lockdowns. Demand has improved a little since the month of June and for those seeking to purchase a home for end-use, experts feel that this is the best possible time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: 400">Demand is steadily coming back to the market. In some business sectors like IT, employees have garnered decent bonuses and salary hikes even for FY2020-21 and with projected 8.5-10% of economic growth in 2021-22, purchasing power may be enhanced more. The current hybrid working model may continue, prompting many buyers to switch from rented apartments in prime locations near their offices to their own homes on the periphery of major cities. Some are also upgrading to bigger housing units with ample space for setting up a home office. Some property platforms have confirmed that 35-40% of buyers are seeking to upgrade their homes. Real estate prices have mostly remained static or corrected in major markets with some markets witnessing only slim 2-3% gains annually for more than 8 years. The chances of prices falling downwards after a prolonged downward spiral are very less as per industry experts.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: 400">Several developers have already revised pricing since commodity costs have gone up for them, spurring higher input expenditure. New projects will automatically account for these extra costs and be priced at higher rates. Multi-year lows in ready to move inventory in cities like Mumbai and Delhi indicates clear buyer preference in this category. Principal Partner &amp; Director Sales at Square Yards, <strong>Kapil Malhotra</strong>, feels that prices may inch upwards if recovery happens smoothly. Home loan interest rates are already at their lowest thresholds. After Maharashtra’s example, even West Bengal has reduced stamp duty and circle rates. The Delhi Government has also lowered circle rates till 30</span><span style="font-weight: 400">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> September, 2021. These new developments may reduce buyer costs even further.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: 400">Malhotra opines that Grade A developers may not always offer discounts on properties although buyers may still be able to negotiate 8-10% discounts from Grade B and Grade C developers although these may withdraw with a pick-up in demand. Some realty players are still providing 9:91 or 20:80 payment plans although the quantum of offers is much lower. Many peripheral zones are also benefiting from the advent of metro railway connectivity and several new areas are emerging as favored destinations in cities like Hyderabad and Bengaluru where rates are still attractive.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: 400">Experts feel that buying for end-use is only advisable if there is low income risk and the buyer is certain that he/she will reside in a particular area with family for a minimum of 10 years. If not, then the purchase should now be deferred and savings invested in other channels as per experts. Expenditure of 8-10% of the price will be incurred in a single round of sale and purchase. Hence, living for 10 years will at least justify this expenditure. There are risks of a third wave of the coronavirus and single income households may be under pressure to arrange around 20% of the cost as down payment while having a minimum corpus of 24 months of home loan EMIs and arrange a hedge against any job losses and financial risks. 24 months will suffice for double income households where spouses may take care of expenses. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-justify">Societies are often stringent about keeping accurate records and paperwork. The managing committees of a housing society have the key responsibility of ensuring that all the proof of sale towards the property is rightfully issued. A<strong>&nbsp;share certificate</strong>, quite like the sale deed is proper proof that the rightful owner of the said property must possess.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Sometimes,&nbsp;<strong>housing society members&nbsp;</strong>tend to overlook or forget to issue these share certificates to the members which can be a problem in case a property-related issue occurs. While the sale deed does act as proof that you are the official owner of the property, a share certificate is legal proof of the same and is indispensable. The managing committee must ensure you have this but in case you do not have one, you can obtain one with ease.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-a-share-certificate"><strong>What is a Share Certificate?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In simple terms, a&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>&nbsp;is a legal document or certification provided by a cooperative&nbsp;<strong>housing society</strong>&nbsp;to the registered owner of the flat. This is given to the member at no cost and ideally, should be given within six months from the time of&nbsp;<strong>allotment of the shares in the housing society&nbsp;</strong>as per the number of shares subscribed by him/her. This share certificate is an active proof of ownership and should have the name of the said housing society, a distinctive number, number of shares allotted to the member as well as value paid after that. The&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>&nbsp;is free, and the registrar then decided the total authorized value at the time the society has been registered. In an event that the member has cleared all his or her dues and no other hitches are existing, the denial of a share certificate can entitle the member to take legal action against the cooperative&nbsp;<strong>housing society</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-why-do-you-need-a-share-certificate"><strong>Why do you need a Share Certificate?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">A&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>&nbsp;is an indispensable document that solely acts as actual legal proof of ownership to the property and the shareholding within the society. The sale deed is also an important document, but the share certificate trumps that in case of official demand. This answer the question of&nbsp;<strong>what is a share certificate and why do you need it</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-a-checklist-for-the-issuance-of-a-share-certificate"><strong>A Checklist for the Issuance of a Share Certificate&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>What to check before/after getting a share certificate&nbsp;</strong>is stated below and should be well kept in mind.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>The&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>&nbsp;must be collected by the member in person himself/herself.&nbsp;</li><li>There should be no dues or penalties on the member&#8217;s property. In case there are any, they should be immediately paid up.&nbsp;</li><li>An important document called the &#8216;conveyance deed&#8217; that is issued by the builder should be in the possession of the&nbsp;<strong>housing society</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>The&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>&nbsp;should be signed by the secretary, chairman, and any other member of the managing committee along with the official seal of the&nbsp;<strong>housing society</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>The share certificate should be authorized by the managing committee first and only then issued by the secretary.&nbsp;</li><li>The housing society will demand that you give an<strong>&nbsp;indemnity bond</strong>&nbsp;which means that under no circumstances should the allotted shares be transferred to any individual or entity for any purpose whatsoever.&nbsp;</li><li>The names on the&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>&nbsp;should be exactly in the same order as it appears on the original sale agreement between the builder and the member. This includes primary as well as associate members.&nbsp;</li><li>The member will need to indemnify the cooperative housing society against any loans and complete any incomplete paperwork before the&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>&nbsp;can be issued.&nbsp;</li><li>No typos or spelling errors should be there in the name and other content on the sale deed. With this you can stay away from any issues that can arrive in future.</li><li>While collecting the&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>, the member will need to present the original sale deed.&nbsp;</li><li>Ensure that after you collect the&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>, all the required signatures as per the society members, official seal, etc. are present on it.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-transferring-of-share-certificate-in-case-of-resale"><strong>Transferring of Share Certificate in Case of Resale</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Certain norms need to be followed in case of a resale. In such a scenario, the original&nbsp;<strong>share certificate&nbsp;</strong>will have to be given to the housing society along with any other documents as needed. In case the share certificate is being transferred in the name of the new member of the housing society after the resale, all procedures about the transfer of the share certificate will need to be made prior to any finalization. The following mentioned points should be kept in mind under such a circumstance.</p>



<ul><li>The new member will need to pay the premium for the transfer of the share certificate.&nbsp;</li><li>The new member will have to make sure that all dues should be cleared by the previous owner of the property.&nbsp;</li><li>The new member will need to produce all the documents and necessary applications required by the&nbsp;<strong>housing society</strong>. These documents and applications should be in mint condition.&nbsp;</li><li>In an event that the original member dies, his or her consequent heirs will have to make an application for the share transfer to the appointed nominee and a new share certificate will have to be obtained.&nbsp;</li><li>The new share certificate should be issued by the cooperative&nbsp;<strong>housing society</strong>&nbsp;within the stipulated time, a lack of which can allow the member to take necessary legal action.</li><li>Readymade&nbsp;<strong>share certificate&nbsp;</strong>booklets are readily available online. Moreover, you can get them at book printing agencies as well as housing federation offices.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-issuance-of-a-duplicate-share-certificate"><strong>Issuance of a Duplicate Share Certificate&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Just as in the case of any important document, it is advisable to keep the original copy of the&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>&nbsp;in a safe place and a proper condition. If you damage or lose this, getting a duplicate is not a simple task. However, it is difficult but not impossible. You can request the&nbsp;<strong>housing society members</strong>&nbsp;to issue you a new one and for this, you will need to follow the steps mentioned below.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Step 1</strong>&nbsp;– The very first thing you will need to do is visit the local police station within your jurisdiction and file an FIR. You will need to add all the details in a registering report that will include details of whether the certificate is lost, damaged, misplaced, stolen, etc. Once this is done, you will need to retain the FIR acknowledgment by the police as you will need it for future communication and reference.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Step 2</strong>&nbsp;– Once the FIR is complete, you will then need to inform the housing society members of this mishap. For this, you will be required to send a written application to them in which you will request them to issue you a new duplicate share certificate. This application will also need to have the details of what happened to the original copy. (i.e whether it is stolen, lost, misplaced, damaged, untraceable, etc.) You will also need to attach the FIR acknowledgment copy that you will have received after filing the FIR. (First Information Report).&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Step 3&nbsp;</strong>– After step 2, you will need to submit an&nbsp;<strong>indemnity bond</strong>&nbsp;of Rs. 200 to the cooperative housing society. This will clear the society of all costs resulting due to the issuance of the new duplicate&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>. All costs that arise for this procedure will have to be borne by the member himself/herself. Make sure that this indemnity bond is officially notarized and attach the FIR acknowledgment copy along with it.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Step 4 –&nbsp;</strong>Once the above-mentioned steps are complete, the managing committee will then review your application along with all the attached paperwork in the next general body meeting in which they will decide whether they want to approve or disapprove your request.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Step 5 –&nbsp;</strong>If your request is approved, the housing society will then display a notice on the main notice board of the society so that all other members can have a look. Additionally, the society will also publish notices in at least two newspapers. All of this will be in regards to the issuing of a duplicate share certificate, the cost of which will need to be paid by the applicant.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Step 6 –&nbsp;</strong>You along with the society will have to wait for a minimum of 15 days to see if any objections are made.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Step 7 –&nbsp;</strong>If everything goes smoothly, and no objections are made, the housing society will then issue a new duplicate share certificate to you which you will have to collect in person when ready.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">So if you have lost or misplaced your original copy and are asking yourself, &#8216;<strong>Can I get a duplicate one?</strong>&#8221; the above-mentioned procedure will help you with the same.  The ownership of a share certificate is extremely important for a property owner in a cooperative housing society. It does not only act as a legal document for your rights but also proves the allotment of shares of that society in your name. Without this share certificate, you can face issues in the future such as transferring the property to the rightful heirs, involvement or rights in any social events, police aid in case of crime, and many other such issues that may occur. Fortunately, even if the<strong> housing society</strong> has forgotten to issue this share certificate to you, you can now get it at any time from them. This article has dotted all the i&#8217;s and cross all the t&#8217;s with its information on the importance of a share certificate. If you have your original copy, ensure you keep it safe and in case you don&#8217;t, go and get it today! </p>

				<h2>In case I request for a duplicate certificate and objections are raised, what happens then?</h2>                <div>
					                    <p>
						Unfortunately, the issuance of a duplicate share certificate is not as easy as getting the original one. More often than not, no one objects, but for some reason, if someone has a valid reason to raise one, the matter will then need to be taken up in court. You will need to fight a case for this in that case                    </p>

						You are liable to be the owner once your dad passes away unless he chooses to do so before his demise. In either case, your dad, in this case, will need to transfer the share certificate in your name by taking the help of the housing society and following the official procedures. In case he does meet his end, you will then need to take up this procedure yourself and get the share certificate transferred in your name, making you the official owner.

						The registrar will decide the value of the shares. This is usually done by dividing the total authorized capital by Rs. 50 per share. The share certificates are distributed based on this. E.g., for every ten shares, the property member gets shares worth Rs. 500                    </p>

						You shouldn&#8217;t lose the original share certificate as the duplicate, while not tedious, can be a long-drawn procedure that will involve you making rounds of the police station, housing society offices, and even court if there are disapprovals.                    </p>
