            "content_html": "\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The Lakshmi Vilas Palace is one of the most magnificent mansions ever created, set among enormous gardens, mango orchards, and sweeping fields. It was commissioned in 1880 by Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III and is four times the size of Buckingham Palace, with a total area of 700 acres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The magnificent palace, which was completed in about 1890 has been the residence of the Gaekwads, the rulers of the Princely State of Baroda, Gujarat for more than a century. The Palace compound includes numerous additional institutes, including the Baroda Golf Club, the Maharaja Fatehsinhrao Museum, and Motibaug Cricket Grounds, all of which are located inside its enormous property. The palace grounds are so large that they previously hosted a small zoo and a miniature train line to transport the royal children around. Due to the employment of domes, minarets, and arches, the palace is a perfect blend of Hindu, Mughal, and Gothic architectural styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-project-s-doomed-architect\"><strong>The Project&#8217;s Doomed Architect</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The project&#8217;s lead architect Major Charles Mant was a well-known architect during his time. The Lakshmi Vilas was his most ambitious undertaking, having constructed palaces at Darbhanga, Bihar, and Kolhapur. Despite being an enthusiastic architect, he was believed to suffer from melancholy and paranoia, eventually leading to his death midway through the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">His death is said to have been the result of a suicide attempt motivated by fear. There are two theories as to what caused the anxiety or shame that drove him to such extremes. The first claims that he was concerned that his calculations were incorrect, and that the palace might collapse at any moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The other claims that an inverted North symbol on the blueprints caused the palace to be erected in the mirror image of the design. As a result, the palace&#8217;s main entrance is on the backside. In any case, the architect died in the middle of the project, and Robert Fellows Chisolm was hired to take his place. Robert Fellows Chisholm, the designer architect, spent twelve years completing this magnificent edifice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-magnificent-palace\"><strong>The Magnificent Palace</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The palace was constructed for GBP 180,000 and had modern amenities such as elevators, an internal telephone system, and an electricity supply. The mansion was meant to be the most lavish edifice in the Baroda State, using materials sourced from all around the state. Even the building workers were only the best, and in some instances, they were even brought in from overseas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The palace&#8217;s facade is made of golden stone from Songadh mines, which gives it a distinctive golden light when seen in the dark and morning. The palace&#8217;s exterior is adorned with elements such as tiny domed &#8220;chattris&#8221; with finials, cusped arched entries, and jharokha windows, all in the Indo-Saracenic design. The outside is also decorated with finely carved stone patterns, brackets, and bands of carvings and paintings. In addition to these components, it also has a large structure that was supposed to be a clock tower but never turned out to be. Alternatively, a tiny red light was put on it to alert the populace if the monarch was there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Although the exteriors were the focus, the interiors are no less. The interiors are organized around two courtyards with trees and water fountains that quickly transport you to India&#8217;s tropical environment. The pleasant afternoons are provided by the trees and the water fountain, while the regal aspect is contributed by marble statues and cast-iron lamp posts. Aside from that, the interiors have been lavishly adorned with elaborate stucco work, paintings, foreign-made crystal chandeliers, stained glass windows, Venetian floor mosaics, exquisite furniture, and sculptures by Felici, the renowned Italian artist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">This palace has enormous stairs with ornate marble railings and wide long hallways, much like any other palace. The palace is surrounded by these passageways, which give sufficient natural lighting and ventilation. The 170 large and tiny rooms are connected by magnificent stairways and long darkened hallways, some with themes such as the silver room or the gulabi (pink) room. The Darbar Hall is arguably the most remarkable of them, and without even viewing it, one cannot fully appreciate the palace&#8217;s magnificence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>The Darbar Hall:</strong> This great hall, which is approximately 5000 Sq. Ft in size is where the most exquisite music and dance events, as well as the most extravagant feasts, were held. The juxtaposing golden decorations above the arches and the dark brown wooden balconies gazing down from the first floor provide vitality to the hall, which is painted in a pale ivory tone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The intricate Venetian floor mosaic on the double-height hall&#8217;s floor contrasts with geometric designs in green and red on the ceiling. The bright belgian stained glass windows add to the overall effect. When the hall is lighted up with large crystal chandeliers echoing the hues of the ceilings and painting the space in a regal air, the entire design comes together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>The Gaddi Hall:</strong> The Gaddi Hall is famous for housing the throne, which has been occupied by numerous monarchs in the past. An amazing number of beautiful artworks are stitched throughout the extremely huge space. The paintings of Goddess Saraswati, Laxmi, and Lord Krishna, among others, are meticulously placed to create a feeling of harmony and balance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>The Pratap Shastragar:</strong> The Pratap Shastragar, or royal armoury, is located in a visitor-friendly section of the palace. The age-old weaponry that was previously used by the royal family and troops of the Baroda State Army are stored here, behind the enormous glass cases. The Rajratna Prof. Manikrao, the man who renovated the Jummadada Vyayam Mandir, selected this assortment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>The Gardens:</strong> William Goldring, a landscape architect from Kew Gardens, manicured the gardens surrounding the palace. The Sunken Garden, located just outside the mansion, is the most famous of them. Human statues in marble and bronze, as well as decorative marble urns, are scattered around the gardens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>The Gates:</strong> The primary and sole magnificent entrance to the palace is located at the end of the Rajmahal Road, among the many gates allowing access to the many parts of the mansion. The king/royal clan have their own gate, which is equally as impressive as the palace itself. This doorway, like the other gates found in Gaekwadi Era structures, has a centre section with a Bengali roof surrounded by two towers and two smaller entrances topped with domes. The structure is made of the same stone as the castle and is embellished with etchings of animals and ornate patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>A model railway and a zoo:</strong> The mansion formerly had its own miniature railway and zoo. To transport his children from the school to the main Lakshmi Vilas Palace, the King built a small train line that encircled the mango grove within the palace grounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-surroundings-of-the-palace\"><strong>The surroundings of the Palace</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>The Fatehsinhrao Museum: </strong>The Fatehsinhrao Museum was built as a schoolhouse for the king&#8217;s children. The museum now houses a vast collection of works of art belonging to the royal family. The most notable of these is the magnificent collection of Raja Ravi Varma&#8217;s paintings, which were particularly acquired by the Maharaja of Baroda.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The museum is well-known among the locals for hosting the yearly Fort Building Competition and the Ganpati Idol Making Competition, both of which are open to both adults and children.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>The Cricket Association and the Motibaug Palace:</strong> The Motibaug Palace is really a modest structure that precedes the mansion itself. It was originally built during Maharaja Ganpatrao Gaekwad&#8217;s era to accommodate the State&#8217;s architects and engineers. The Gaekwad Baroda Golf Club&#8217;s main club is now housed there. The Moti Bagh Cricket Ground, the administration of the Baroda Cricket Association, and a very unusual indoor teak coated tennis and badminton court are next to the Motibaug Palace and the Museum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>The Golf Club:</strong> Maharaja Pratapsinhrao built a golf course for his European visitors in the 1930s. The course was rebuilt and offered to the general populace in the 1990s by Pratapsinhrao&#8217;s grandson Samarjitsinh, a renowned Ranji Trophy cricket player. The Gaekwad Baroda Golf Club upgraded the course in 2004 into a magnificent course that presently has over 900 members.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>The LVP Banquets:</strong> The LVP Banquets was established a few years ago with a tiny facility comprising of a few large and small halls. The sunken gardens, which are a part of the mansion, are also available for hire by the Banquets for arranging parties and ceremonies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>A massive tree and an ecology: </strong>Over time, the gardens around the palace have acquired their own environment. Around the royal compound, langoors and peacocks may be seen in packs. Aside from that, the complex is home to a massive Banyan tree known as the &#8220;Sayaji Vad,&#8221; which is over a century old and has its own ecology.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-facts-about-lakshmi-vilas-palace\"><strong>Facts about Lakshmi Vilas Palace</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Did you know that it is known to be the world&#8217;s largest private residence?</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The interiors are reminiscent of a large European country house.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It had elevators when it was built, which was unusual.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Prem Rog released in 1982, Dil Hi Toh Hai released in 1993, Sardaar Gabbar Singh released in 2016, and Grand Masti released in 2013, are just a few of the Bollywood films shot in this palace.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-valuation-of-vadodara-s-lakshmi-vilas-palace\"><strong>Valuation of Vadodara&#8217;s Lakshmi Vilas Palace</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III constructed Lakshmi Vilas Palace in 1890 for a staggering \u20b927,00,000 (\u00a31,80,000), which was a considerable sum at that time. The Moti Bagh Cricket Ground, as well as the administration of the well-known Baroda Cricket Association are located near the museum. Navlakhi Vav, a famous stepwell dating from 1405 AD, is also included inside the complex. While it is nearly hard to correctly describe the value of such a massive and intimidating national landmark, estimations suggest that property values in this location might range from \u20b97,000 to \u20b98,000 per Sq. Ft. Taking all into consideration, it is worth noting that the palace compound covers 700 acres or 3,04,92,000 Sq. Ft. Using the current market cost of \u20b98,000 per Sq. Ft as a guide, the ultimate worth would be at least \u20b92,43,93,60,00,000. To put it another way, the Lakshmi Vilas Palace would be valued at a staggering twenty-four thousand three hundred and sixty crores and sixty lakhs. Given the structure&#8217;s cultural significance and history, this figure may potentially reach \u20b925,000 crores.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-ending-remarks\"><strong>Ending Remarks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Overall, the palace is the pinnacle of grandeur and a testament of a king who used to be the world&#8217;s eighth richest man. The palace is one of the greatest examples of Indo-Saracenic architecture, which combines Hindu, Mughal, Rajasthani, and Western design. It is adorned with items by some of the world&#8217;s finest artisans. Last but not least, it is a depiction of the splendour of an Indian princely state. Picture the magnificence of India, which at one time had about 800 similar Princely States.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-you-might-also-like\">You Might Also Like</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul

The king/royal clan have their own gate, which is equally as impressive as the palace itself. This doorway, like the other gates found in Gaekwadi Era structures, has a centre section with a Bengali roof surrounded by two towers and two smaller entrances topped with domes. The structure is made of the same stone as the castle and is embellished with etchings of animals and ornate patterns.\n\n\n\nA model railway and a zoo: The mansion formerly had its own miniature railway and zoo. To transport his children from the school to the main Lakshmi Vilas Palace, the King built a small train line that encircled the mango grove within the palace grounds.\n\n\n\nThe surroundings of the Palace\n\n\n\nThe Fatehsinhrao Museum: The Fatehsinhrao Museum was built as a schoolhouse for the king&#8217;s children. The museum now houses a vast collection of works of art belonging to the royal family. The most notable of these is the magnificent collection of Raja Ravi Varma&#8217;s paintings, which were particularly acquired by the Maharaja of Baroda.\n\n\n\nThe museum is well-known among the locals for hosting the yearly Fort Building Competition and the Ganpati Idol Making Competition, both of which are open to both adults and children.\n\n\n\nThe Cricket Association and the Motibaug Palace: The Motibaug Palace is really a modest structure that precedes the mansion itself. It was originally built during Maharaja Ganpatrao Gaekwad&#8217;s era to accommodate the State&#8217;s architects and engineers. The Gaekwad Baroda Golf Club&#8217;s main club is now housed there. The Moti Bagh Cricket Ground, the administration of the Baroda Cricket Association, and a very unusual indoor teak coated tennis and badminton court are next to the Motibaug Palace and the Museum.\n\n\n\nThe Golf Club: Maharaja Pratapsinhrao built a golf course for his European visitors in the 1930s. The course was rebuilt and offered to the general populace in the 1990s by Pratapsinhrao&#8217;s grandson Samarjitsinh, a renowned Ranji Trophy cricket player. The Gaekwad Baroda Golf Club upgraded the course in 2004 into a magnificent course that presently has over 900 members.\n\n\n\nThe LVP Banquets: The LVP Banquets was established a few years ago with a tiny facility comprising of a few large and small halls. The sunken gardens, which are a part of the mansion, are also available for hire by the Banquets for arranging parties and ceremonies.\n\n\n\nA massive tree and an ecology: Over time, the gardens around the palace have acquired their own environment. Around the royal compound, langoors and peacocks may be seen in packs. Aside from that, the complex is home to a massive Banyan tree known as the &#8220;Sayaji Vad,&#8221; which is over a century old and has its own ecology.\n\n\n\nFacts about Lakshmi Vilas Palace\n\n\n\nDid you know that it is known to be the world&#8217;s largest private residence?\n\n\n\nThe interiors are reminiscent of a large European country house.\n\n\n\nIt had elevators when it was built, which was unusual.\n\n\n\nPrem Rog released in 1982, Dil Hi Toh Hai released in 1993, Sardaar Gabbar Singh released in 2016, and Grand Masti released in 2013, are just a few of the Bollywood films shot in this palace.\n\n\n\nValuation of Vadodara&#8217;s Lakshmi Vilas Palace\n\n\n\nMaharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III constructed Lakshmi Vilas Palace in 1890 for a staggering \u20b927,00,000 (\u00a31,80,000), which was a considerable sum at that time. The Moti Bagh Cricket Ground, as well as the administration of the well-known Baroda Cricket Association are located near the museum. Navlakhi Vav, a famous stepwell dating from 1405 AD, is also included inside the complex. While it is nearly hard to correctly describe the value of such a massive and intimidating national landmark, estimations suggest that property values in this location might range from \u20b97,000 to \u20b98,000 per Sq. Ft. Taking all into consideration, it is worth noting that the palace compound covers 700 acres or 3,04,92,000 Sq. Ft. Using the current market cost of \u20b98,000 per Sq. Ft as a guide, the ultimate worth would be at least \u20b92,43,93,60,00,000. To put it another way, the Lakshmi Vilas Palace would be valued at a staggering twenty-four thousand three hundred and sixty crores and sixty lakhs. Given the structure&#8217;s cultural significance and history, this figure may potentially reach \u20b925,000 crores.\n\n\n\nEnding Remarks\n\n\n\nOverall, the palace is the pinnacle of grandeur and a testament of a king who used to be the world&#8217;s eighth richest man. The palace is one of the greatest examples of Indo-Saracenic architecture, which combines Hindu, Mughal, Rajasthani, and Western design. It is adorned with items by some of the world&#8217;s finest artisans. Last but not least, it is a depiction of the splendour of an Indian princely state. Picture the magnificence of India, which at one time had about 800 similar Princely States.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s Dig Deep Into The Grandeur of Vadodara\u2019s Lakshmi Vilas PalacePataudi Palace \u2013 Taimur\u2019s \u20b9800 Cr Royal InheritanceThe worth of Mysore Palace might surprise you!Make your  Small Abode a Happy Place to Live inLiving room decor ideas for cricket lovers\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ&#8217;s)\n\n\n        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhat is the location of Lakshmi Vilas Palace?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tJN Marg, Moti Baug, Vadodara is where Lakshmi Vilas Palace can be found.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWho is the palace&#8217;s principal architect?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe palace&#8217;s principal architect is claimed to be Major Charles Mant.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhat is the size of the Lakshmi Vilas Palace&#8217;s entire area?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Lakshmi Vilas Palace is spread across over 700 acres.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tIs it true that Lakshmi Vilas Palace is larger than Buckingham Palace?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe palace of Laxmi Vilas is four times the size of Buckingham Palace.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhat is the name of the person who owns Lakshmi Vilas Palace?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt is now headed by HRH Samarjitsinh Gaekwad, who is married to Radhikaraje Gaekwad and has two daughters with her.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t\nThe post Let\u2019s Dig Deep Into The Grandeur of Vadodara\u2019s Lakshmi Vilas Palace appeared first on Real Estate News.",

It is well recognized for housing several notable government officials&#8217; private homes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Raj Bhavan, Maharashtra&#8217;s Governor&#8217;s official estate, and Varsha Bungalow-Maharashtra&#8217;s Chief Minister&#8217;s house, all are located on Malabar Hill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Pallonji Mistry, the Petit family, the Jindal family, Adi Godrej, and Shashi Ruia are among the numerous corporate moguls that call this posh locality their home.

It was once a fishing town. It has been turned into an urban residential hotspot owing to its strategic position and world-class facilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">It also links the Bandra Kurla Complex and Nariman Point, two of Mumbai&#8217;s most prominent business districts. As a result, Worli has become one of Mumbai&#8217;s most premium suburbs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The magnificent Bandra-Worli Sea Link, which opened in 2009, has added to Worli&#8217;s skyrocketing land values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Worli is now considerably more accessible thanks to the bridge that links it to Bandra, Mumbai&#8217;s western district. Worli is home to a number of famous entrepreneurs, including Narayan Murthy, Anil Agarwal, Nandan Nilekani, Anand Piramal, and Isha Ambani.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail stores, eateries, nightclubs, and other commercial enterprises dominate the neighbourhood, making it one of the most popular recreational spots for working professionals on the island metropolis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The average price of a residence in Worli is \u20b937,013 per square foot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tardeo: Top Expensive Areas in Mumbai</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Tardeo is an upscale area in South Mumbai that stretches from Nana Chowk to Haji Ali Junction. Its initial crowning achievement was the establishment of Crossroads, Mumbai&#8217;s first retail mall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Altamount Road in Tardeo is a major thoroughfare in south Mumbai that links key business sectors in the area. It is also home to Antilla, which is India&#8217;s most valuable private property, Tardeo contains a variety of commercial buildings, including educational and healthcare facilities. Because there are limited residential possibilities in the region, it is one of Mumbai&#8217;s most pricey locations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The average price of a residence in Tardeo is \u20b947,786 per square foot.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-juhu-beverly-hills-of-bollywood\"><strong>Juhu: Beverly Hills of Bollywood</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">When a residential area is affectionately dubbed as the &#8220;Beverly Hills of Bollywood,&#8221; you know it&#8217;s upscale.

Siraj Lokhandwala bought the region in 1968 when it was still just a large swamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Many realtors attempted to talk him out of it at the time, claiming that people wouldn&#8217;t want to live so far from the city core. Lokhandwala Complex now has become one of Mumbai&#8217;s most coveted suburbs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Lokhandwala Complex, which is home to numerous movie stars, directors, and singers, is full of luxurious retail malls, gourmet restaurants, and trendy caf\u00e9s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">There are also a number of well-kept parks and walking tracks.

It does rounds on the Internet when a business tycoon or Bollywood celebrity buys an apartment or building for a very high sum. Mumbai is consistently ranked one of the most expensive places to buy property.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Price is defined by the relationship of demand and supply, as most of us are aware. The greater the cost, the lesser the supply. Likewise, when demand increases, so does the cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-so-what-are-the-causes-that-are-reducing-property-supply-and-raising-demand-in-mumbai\"><strong>So, what are the causes that are reducing property supply and raising demand in Mumbai?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Government Policy:</strong> Another aspect is government policy. Circle rates, set by the government, determine not just the minimum stamp duty but also the starting price. Mumbai&#8217;s prices have gone up by upto 20% in past years, which is significantly higher than the rest of the nation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Rent Control:</strong> Rent regulation has an impact on real estate supply since a significant proportion of renters, particularly in the city&#8217;s best locations, may live on monthly rates of less than 500 rupees. Because landowners are not allowed to raise this rent due to government price controls, the burden on non-rent-controlled properties to generate taxes is considerably greater.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Inward Migration:</strong> For years, Mumbai has undoubtedly been India&#8217;s business hub. Mumbai has opportunities for everyone, from white-collar occupations to basic labour sustaining the wealthy&#8217;s lives. However, this inflow of migrants puts strain on the city to provide housing. <strong>Investment Buyers:</strong> A type of purchaser branded as &#8220;investment buyers&#8221; \u2013 individuals who have no intention of living in Mumbai but want to purchase real estate there in the hopes of profiting later \u2013 is also creating too much demand. These purchasers, who are mostly non-resident Indians or individuals with significant sums of unregulated money, add to the already massive demand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-you-might-also-like\">You Might Also Like</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-yoast-seo-related-links\"><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/posh-areas-in-mumbai\">Posh Areas in Mumbai: Coveted Destinations in Maximum City</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/top-localities-to-invest-in-mumbai-real-estate\">Top Localities to Invest in Mumbai Real Estate</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/worli-becomes-luxury-housing-destination-in-mumbai\">Worli becomes luxury housing destination in Mumbai</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/branded-residences-become-trend-dubai-realty-market\">Branded residences become a trend in Dubai realty market</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/a-complete-guide-to-mumbais-queen-of-the-suburbs-bandra-west\">A Complete Guide to Mumbai&#8217;s Queen of the Suburbs: Bandra West</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-frequently-asked-questions-faq-s\">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ&#8217;s)</h2>\n\n\n        <section class=\"sc_fs_faq sc_card\">\n            <div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Is Andheri an affluent neighbourhood?</h2>                <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAndheri is a semi-affluent neighbourhood where housing costs are rising due to great demand, yet housing options are limited.                    </p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </section>\n\t        <section class=\"sc_fs_faq sc_card\">\n            <div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Is Juhu an affluent neighbourhood?</h2>                <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYes, Juhu is one of Mumbai&#8217;s affluent neighbourhoods.

The Girgaon Chowpatty Beach, Back Bay, and Nariman Point are all within walking distance of most residences in this region, which provide unobstructed views of the Mumbai skyline.\n\n\n\nThis is one of the primary causes behind Malabar Hill&#8217;s exorbitant real estate costs. It is well recognized for housing several notable government officials&#8217; private homes.\n\n\n\nRaj Bhavan, Maharashtra&#8217;s Governor&#8217;s official estate, and Varsha Bungalow-Maharashtra&#8217;s Chief Minister&#8217;s house, all are located on Malabar Hill.\n\n\n\nPallonji Mistry, the Petit family, the Jindal family, Adi Godrej, and Shashi Ruia are among the numerous corporate moguls that call this posh locality their home.

It was once a fishing town. It has been turned into an urban residential hotspot owing to its strategic position and world-class facilities.\n\n\n\nIt also links the Bandra Kurla Complex and Nariman Point, two of Mumbai&#8217;s most prominent business districts. As a result, Worli has become one of Mumbai&#8217;s most premium suburbs.\n\n\n\nThe magnificent Bandra-Worli Sea Link, which opened in 2009, has added to Worli&#8217;s skyrocketing land values.\n\n\n\nWorli is now considerably more accessible thanks to the bridge that links it to Bandra, Mumbai&#8217;s western district. Worli is home to a number of famous entrepreneurs, including Narayan Murthy, Anil Agarwal, Nandan Nilekani, Anand Piramal, and Isha Ambani.\n\n\n\nRetail stores, eateries, nightclubs, and other commercial enterprises dominate the neighbourhood, making it one of the most popular recreational spots for working professionals on the island metropolis.\n\n\n\nThe average price of a residence in Worli is \u20b937,013 per square foot.\n\n\n\nTardeo: Top Expensive Areas in Mumbai\n\n\n\nTardeo is an upscale area in South Mumbai that stretches from Nana Chowk to Haji Ali Junction. Its initial crowning achievement was the establishment of Crossroads, Mumbai&#8217;s first retail mall.\n\n\n\nAltamount Road in Tardeo is a major thoroughfare in south Mumbai that links key business sectors in the area. It is also home to Antilla, which is India&#8217;s most valuable private property, Tardeo contains a variety of commercial buildings, including educational and healthcare facilities.

It does rounds on the Internet when a business tycoon or Bollywood celebrity buys an apartment or building for a very high sum. Mumbai is consistently ranked one of the most expensive places to buy property.\n\n\n\nPrice is defined by the relationship of demand and supply, as most of us are aware. The greater the cost, the lesser the supply. Likewise, when demand increases, so does the cost.\n\n\n\nSo, what are the causes that are reducing property supply and raising demand in Mumbai?\n\n\n\nGovernment Policy: Another aspect is government policy. Circle rates, set by the government, determine not just the minimum stamp duty but also the starting price. Mumbai&#8217;s prices have gone up by upto 20% in past years, which is significantly higher than the rest of the nation.\n\n\n\nRent Control: Rent regulation has an impact on real estate supply since a significant proportion of renters, particularly in the city&#8217;s best locations, may live on monthly rates of less than 500 rupees. Because landowners are not allowed to raise this rent due to government price controls, the burden on non-rent-controlled properties to generate taxes is considerably greater.\n\n\n\nInward Migration: For years, Mumbai has undoubtedly been India&#8217;s business hub. Mumbai has opportunities for everyone, from white-collar occupations to basic labour sustaining the wealthy&#8217;s lives. However, this inflow of migrants puts strain on the city to provide housing. Investment Buyers: A type of purchaser branded as &#8220;investment buyers&#8221; \u2013 individuals who have no intention of living in Mumbai but want to purchase real estate there in the hopes of profiting later \u2013 is also creating too much demand. These purchasers, who are mostly non-resident Indians or individuals with significant sums of unregulated money, add to the already massive demand.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\nPosh Areas in Mumbai: Coveted Destinations in Maximum CityTop Localities to Invest in Mumbai Real EstateWorli becomes luxury housing destination in MumbaiBranded residences become a trend in Dubai realty marketA Complete Guide to Mumbai&#8217;s Queen of the Suburbs: Bandra West\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ&#8217;s)\n\n\n        \n            \n\t\t\t\tIs Andheri an affluent neighbourhood?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAndheri is a semi-affluent neighbourhood where housing costs are rising due to great demand, yet housing options are limited.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tIs Juhu an affluent neighbourhood?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tYes, Juhu is one of Mumbai&#8217;s affluent neighbourhoods.

            "content_html": "\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Understanding the technical jargon used by real estate brokers is critical for potential homebuyers to prevent mistakes that might jeopardize their chances of acquiring the house of their dreams. In India, developers and agents frequently use the words carpet area, built-up area, and super built-up area, prompting many people to search for explanations on the internet. In reality, some fraudulent companies have taken advantage of customers&#8217; lack of information by demanding greater costs. As a result, it is critical that you complete your study before speaking with your agent again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Square Yards explains the distinctions between the carpet area, built-up area, and super built-up area, three widely used terminologies:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-carpet-area\">Carpet Area</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">A carpet area is an area that may be covered by a carpet, as the name suggests. The actual usable floor space of a house is determined by the distance between walls. Builders are required by RERA (Real Estate Regulation and Development Act) rules to reveal the carpet area of each unit upon which the selling price must be determined. This space does not include the area occupied by the exterior walls, balcony, or terrace, unlike the built-up area described below. The carpet area, which becomes your personal space, however, comprises the thickness of the house&#8217;s interior walls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The carpet area covers roughly 70% of the built-up area, which includes the living area, bedrooms, and other rooms, the kitchen and baths, and, on some occasions, even the interior stairway. Assuming you have a built-up space of 1,000 square feet, the carpet area will be 70% of 1,000 square feet or 700 square feet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-calculate-the-carpet-area-using-this-formula\">Calculate the carpet area using this formula</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Carpet area = bedroom + living area + balconies + toilets \u2013 inner wall thickness</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-can-you-make-sure-you-do-not-get-misled-when-it-comes-to-the-carpet-area\">How can you make sure you do not get misled when it comes to the carpet area?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">If you are purchasing a project in a large housing society, the developer is required by the RERA to disclose the carpet area of the unit. However, you need to hire a technical expert to come to the apartment and measure the space. If you apply for a mortgage, the bank will send a technical expert to inspect the property. Check with them to see whether the carpet area that the developer told you about is the same as what they estimated. If there are any inconsistencies, you should notify the developer and renegotiate the price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Another important point to keep in mind when buying a home is not to be carried away by the built-up or super-built-up area figures if the carpet area is not as per your preference. At the end of the day, the carpet area is the area that you will use in your everyday life. Ascertain that the three figures are perfectly balanced, with the carpet area taking the lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-a-few-other-things-to-keep-in-mind\">A few other things to keep in mind</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">While developers are now legally required to disclose the carpet area when measuring and pricing flats, provisions have been created for the measurement to be increased or decreased while a project is under construction. If the carpet area is lowered during construction, the developer is required to repay the extra cost to the customer within 45 days, plus yearly interest. If the carpet area is increased, the developer may require the buyer to pay the difference. The RERA, on the other hand, stipulates that the increase in carpet area cannot exceed 3%.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-built-up-area\">Built-up Area</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The built-up area is the total size of the residential unit, which includes the carpet area as well as the thickness of the walls. This includes the area covered by the balcony or terrace. It usually accounts for roughly 70 to 80 percent of the estate&#8217;s super built-up area. It should be remembered that the proportion may differ depending on the project or builder. The built-up area, on the other hand, is created by adding 10 to 15% more room to the carpet area. Assuming a super built-up area of 1,200 square feet, the built-up area will be 70% or 80% of 1,200 square feet, or 840 square feet or 960 square feet, respectively, while the carpet area will be 588 square feet or 672 square feet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-calculate-the-built-up-area-using-this-formula\">Calculate the built-up area using this formula</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Built-up area = carpet area + wall area + balcony area</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-carpet-area-vs-built-up-area-what-is-the-difference\">Carpet Area vs Built-up Area: What is the difference?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Carpet area refers to the space that may be covered by a carpet, whereas built-up area refers to the area that remains after the carpet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-super-built-up-area\">Super Built-up Area</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The super built-up area is the total of the built-up area plus the space used by common spaces such as the lobby, stairwell, lift, shafts, and clubhouse, among other things. Developers frequently charge consumers depending on this area to recoup their building costs. As a result, it is known as the &#8220;saleable&#8221; area. The loading factor, which is the proportionate share of the common space in a flat derived by multiplying the carpet area by a multiplier (1.25), is closely linked to the super built-up area. This equates to a 25% or 30% increase in total saleable area. The difference between the super built-up area and the carpet area is used to calculate its value. The loading factor is used by many builders to determine the pricing of a unit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Developers frequently utilized the super-built-up area as the space-measuring unit before the RERA made it necessary for them to sell apartments based on carpet area, to take advantage of the lack of clarity on space computation. They were able to reduce the properties per Sq. Ft cost by using a super built-up area as the measurement unit. It also gave the customer the idea that they were purchasing a huge home when they weren&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Since it becomes a benchmark for builders to charge their customers, the super built-up area is also known as the saleable area,\u201d says Vijay Verma, CEO, Sunworld Group. The computation of a super built-up area is done differently when there is more than one unit on a level, he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Assume a residence with a carpet area of 1,000 square feet that costs \u20b92,000 per square foot. The total cost of the property, in this case, will be \u20b920,00,000. A builder will give the super built-up area (let&#8217;s say, 1,300 sq. ft) and price the home cheaper at, say, \u20b91,800 per Sq. Ft to make the marketing pitch even more appealing. In this case, the property&#8217;s total price will be \u20b923.40 lakhs. The latter would sound far more appealing to an uninformed consumer than the former.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-calculate-the-super-built-up-area-using-this-formula\">Calculate the super built-up area using this formula</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Built-up area + proportional common area = super built-up area.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Or</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Carpet&nbsp;area (1+loading factor) = Super built-up area</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Remember:</strong> Based on the developer and the specific location, the loading might be anywhere from 15 to 50 percent.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-example-of-calculating-the-super-built-up-area\"><strong>Example of calculating the super built-up area</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The super built-up area is computed differently when there are many units on a floor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Suppose Rahul Patel owns a flat with a built-up area of 1,000 Sq. Ft on the fifth level of a housing society. Arun Prasad has a flat on the same level with a built-up area of 2,000 square feet. The floor&#8217;s entire common area is 1,500 square feet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">To calculate the super built-up area of the two flats the developer would split the built-up areas of the two flats by their ratio (in this example 1:2), then add 500 square feet to Patel&#8217;s total built-up area and 1,000 square feet to Prasad&#8217;s built-up area. Patel&#8217;s flat now has a super built-up size of 1,500 Sq. Ft, whereas Prasad&#8217;s has a super built-up area of 3,000 square feet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-can-purchasers-refuse-to-pay-for-a-developer-s-increase-in-carpet-area\"><strong>Can purchasers refuse to pay for a developer&#8217;s increase in carpet area?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Due to revisions in the plan and an increase in the carpet area, the developer has increased the overall price of the house on several occasions. The purchaser is responsible for the additional charges under RERA&#8217;s terms. In a case brought by Ashley Neil Serrao and Mark Clement Serrao, who had acquired a property in Runwal Greens by Propel Developers Pvt Ltd, the Maharashtra RERA has openly stated that the purchaser is responsible for paying the extra money.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-to-determine-the-area-of-your-future-home-s-usable-space\"><strong>How to determine the area of your future home&#8217;s usable space?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Always inquire about the carpet area of the apartment and base your price negotiations on this figure. You could seek the assistance of a private technical assessor to re-confirm the carpet area in the apartment so that there is no room for any deception. Those who purchase a home with the aid of housing financing are in a stronger position since the bank will send its own legal and technical assessors to inspect the property&#8217;s specifications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Another thing to keep in mind is that even if a developer quotes the price of a home-based on carpet area, they will almost always increase per Sq. Ft cost to account for the built-up and super built-up areas. Try to find out how much similar projects in the region cost to see whether the amount your builder offered is reasonable. If not, the buyer has the option of negotiating the agreement and attempting to lower the pricing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-few-more-terms\"><strong>Few More Terms</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-noc-no-objection-certificate\"><strong>NOC (No Objection Certificate)</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">A no objection certificate is a legal document that states that an individual or corporation has been granted authorization to purchase or build real estate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-occupancy-certificate-oc\"><strong>Occupancy certificate (OC)</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The occupancy certificate is a crucial document that verifies that the building was built according to the approved designs and in accordance with local regulations. After verifying that all local laws have been followed, the local municipal corporation releases this document. The occupancy certificate must be obtained by the developer. When offering loans to property buyers, many financial firms require an occupancy certificate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-completion-certificate-cc\"><strong>Completion certificate (CC)</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">A completion certification is a legal document that certifies that a new building has been erected and completed in accordance with the Buildings Act&#8217;s safety standards and regulations, as well as municipal legislation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-haryana-rera-has-issued-laws-requiring-flats-to-be-sold-only-based-on-carpet-area\"><strong>Haryana (RERA) has issued laws requiring flats to be sold only based on carpet area</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">On April 27, 2021, the Haryana Real Estate Regulatory Authority (HARERA) announced that developers can only offer flats in their developments based on carpet area. The state RERA declared that the selling of apartments on a super area or any other bench would be considered deceptive and an unfair commercial activity, and that developers who violated these instructions would face penalties. \u201cIn real estate developments, the property is not correctly represented by stating the super area without precisely describing and breaking down the components contained in the super area. \u201cThe practice of selling real estate on a super area basis is deceptive, imprecise, opaque, and leads to misunderstanding and difficulties, as well as unnecessary litigation,\u201d stated KK Khandelwal, chairman of Haryana RERA.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-you-might-also-like\">You Might Also Like</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-yoast-seo-related-links\"><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/some-of-the-key-terms-used-in-real-estate\">Some of the key terms used in Real Estate</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/rera-carpet-area\">RERA Carpet Area: Things You Must Know About</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/carpet-area-vs-built-up-area-vs-super-area\">Carpet area vs. built up area vs. super area</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/how-carpet-area-definition-changes-in-rera\">How carpet area definition changes in RERA</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/build-up-super-build-up\">Built up &amp;

            "content_text": "Understanding the technical jargon used by real estate brokers is critical for potential homebuyers to prevent mistakes that might jeopardize their chances of acquiring the house of their dreams. In India, developers and agents frequently use the words carpet area, built-up area, and super built-up area, prompting many people to search for explanations on the internet. In reality, some fraudulent companies have taken advantage of customers&#8217; lack of information by demanding greater costs. As a result, it is critical that you complete your study before speaking with your agent again.\n\n\n\nSquare Yards explains the distinctions between the carpet area, built-up area, and super built-up area, three widely used terminologies:\n\n\n\nCarpet Area\n\n\n\nA carpet area is an area that may be covered by a carpet, as the name suggests. The actual usable floor space of a house is determined by the distance between walls. Builders are required by RERA (Real Estate Regulation and Development Act) rules to reveal the carpet area of each unit upon which the selling price must be determined. This space does not include the area occupied by the exterior walls, balcony, or terrace, unlike the built-up area described below. The carpet area, which becomes your personal space, however, comprises the thickness of the house&#8217;s interior walls.\n\n\n\nThe carpet area covers roughly 70% of the built-up area, which includes the living area, bedrooms, and other rooms, the kitchen and baths, and, on some occasions, even the interior stairway. Assuming you have a built-up space of 1,000 square feet, the carpet area will be 70% of 1,000 square feet or 700 square feet.\n\n\n\nCalculate the carpet area using this formula\n\n\n\nCarpet area = bedroom + living area + balconies + toilets \u2013 inner wall thickness\n\n\n\nHow can you make sure you do not get misled when it comes to the carpet area?\n\n\n\nIf you are purchasing a project in a large housing society, the developer is required by the RERA to disclose the carpet area of the unit. However, you need to hire a technical expert to come to the apartment and measure the space. If you apply for a mortgage, the bank will send a technical expert to inspect the property. Check with them to see whether the carpet area that the developer told you about is the same as what they estimated. If there are any inconsistencies, you should notify the developer and renegotiate the price.\n\n\n\nAnother important point to keep in mind when buying a home is not to be carried away by the built-up or super-built-up area figures if the carpet area is not as per your preference. At the end of the day, the carpet area is the area that you will use in your everyday life. Ascertain that the three figures are perfectly balanced, with the carpet area taking the lead.\n\n\n\nA few other things to keep in mind\n\n\n\nWhile developers are now legally required to disclose the carpet area when measuring and pricing flats, provisions have been created for the measurement to be increased or decreased while a project is under construction. If the carpet area is lowered during construction, the developer is required to repay the extra cost to the customer within 45 days, plus yearly interest. If the carpet area is increased, the developer may require the buyer to pay the difference. The RERA, on the other hand, stipulates that the increase in carpet area cannot exceed 3%.\n\n\n\nBuilt-up Area\n\n\n\nThe built-up area is the total size of the residential unit, which includes the carpet area as well as the thickness of the walls. This includes the area covered by the balcony or terrace. It usually accounts for roughly 70 to 80 percent of the estate&#8217;s super built-up area. It should be remembered that the proportion may differ depending on the project or builder. The built-up area, on the other hand, is created by adding 10 to 15% more room to the carpet area. Assuming a super built-up area of 1,200 square feet, the built-up area will be 70% or 80% of 1,200 square feet, or 840 square feet or 960 square feet, respectively, while the carpet area will be 588 square feet or 672 square feet.\n\n\n\nCalculate the built-up area using this formula\n\n\n\nBuilt-up area = carpet area + wall area + balcony area\n\n\n\nCarpet Area vs Built-up Area: What is the difference?\n\n\n\nCarpet area refers to the space that may be covered by a carpet, whereas built-up area refers to the area that remains after the carpet.\n\n\n\nSuper Built-up Area\n\n\n\nThe super built-up area is the total of the built-up area plus the space used by common spaces such as the lobby, stairwell, lift, shafts, and clubhouse, among other things. Developers frequently charge consumers depending on this area to recoup their building costs. As a result, it is known as the &#8220;saleable&#8221; area. The loading factor, which is the proportionate share of the common space in a flat derived by multiplying the carpet area by a multiplier (1.25), is closely linked to the super built-up area. This equates to a 25% or 30% increase in total saleable area. The difference between the super built-up area and the carpet area is used to calculate its value. The loading factor is used by many builders to determine the pricing of a unit.\n\n\n\nDevelopers frequently utilized the super-built-up area as the space-measuring unit before the RERA made it necessary for them to sell apartments based on carpet area, to take advantage of the lack of clarity on space computation. They were able to reduce the properties per Sq. Ft cost by using a super built-up area as the measurement unit. It also gave the customer the idea that they were purchasing a huge home when they weren&#8217;t.\n\n\n\nSince it becomes a benchmark for builders to charge their customers, the super built-up area is also known as the saleable area,\u201d says Vijay Verma, CEO, Sunworld Group. The computation of a super built-up area is done differently when there is more than one unit on a level, he says.\n\n\n\nAssume a residence with a carpet area of 1,000 square feet that costs \u20b92,000 per square foot. The total cost of the property, in this case, will be \u20b920,00,000. A builder will give the super built-up area (let&#8217;s say, 1,300 sq. ft) and price the home cheaper at, say, \u20b91,800 per Sq. Ft to make the marketing pitch even more appealing. In this case, the property&#8217;s total price will be \u20b923.40 lakhs. The latter would sound far more appealing to an uninformed consumer than the former.\n\n\n\nCalculate the super built-up area using this formula\n\n\n\nBuilt-up area + proportional common area = super built-up area.\n\n\n\nOr\n\n\n\nCarpet&nbsp;area (1+loading factor) = Super built-up area\n\n\n\nRemember: Based on the developer and the specific location, the loading might be anywhere from 15 to 50 percent.\n\n\n\nExample of calculating the super built-up area\n\n\n\nThe super built-up area is computed differently when there are many units on a floor.\n\n\n\nSuppose Rahul Patel owns a flat with a built-up area of 1,000 Sq.

The floor&#8217;s entire common area is 1,500 square feet.\n\n\n\nTo calculate the super built-up area of the two flats the developer would split the built-up areas of the two flats by their ratio (in this example 1:2), then add 500 square feet to Patel&#8217;s total built-up area and 1,000 square feet to Prasad&#8217;s built-up area. Patel&#8217;s flat now has a super built-up size of 1,500 Sq. Ft, whereas Prasad&#8217;s has a super built-up area of 3,000 square feet.\n\n\n\nCan purchasers refuse to pay for a developer&#8217;s increase in carpet area?\n\n\n\nDue to revisions in the plan and an increase in the carpet area, the developer has increased the overall price of the house on several occasions. The purchaser is responsible for the additional charges under RERA&#8217;s terms. In a case brought by Ashley Neil Serrao and Mark Clement Serrao, who had acquired a property in Runwal Greens by Propel Developers Pvt Ltd, the Maharashtra RERA has openly stated that the purchaser is responsible for paying the extra money.\n\n\n\nHow to determine the area of your future home&#8217;s usable space?\n\n\n\nAlways inquire about the carpet area of the apartment and base your price negotiations on this figure. You could seek the assistance of a private technical assessor to re-confirm the carpet area in the apartment so that there is no room for any deception. Those who purchase a home with the aid of housing financing are in a stronger position since the bank will send its own legal and technical assessors to inspect the property&#8217;s specifications.\n\n\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that even if a developer quotes the price of a home-based on carpet area, they will almost always increase per Sq. Ft cost to account for the built-up and super built-up areas. Try to find out how much similar projects in the region cost to see whether the amount your builder offered is reasonable. If not, the buyer has the option of negotiating the agreement and attempting to lower the pricing.\n\n\n\nFew More Terms\n\n\n\nNOC (No Objection Certificate)\n\n\n\nA no objection certificate is a legal document that states that an individual or corporation has been granted authorization to purchase or build real estate.\n\n\n\nOccupancy certificate (OC)\n\n\n\nThe occupancy certificate is a crucial document that verifies that the building was built according to the approved designs and in accordance with local regulations. After verifying that all local laws have been followed, the local municipal corporation releases this document. The occupancy certificate must be obtained by the developer. When offering loans to property buyers, many financial firms require an occupancy certificate.\n\n\n\nCompletion certificate (CC)\n\n\n\nA completion certification is a legal document that certifies that a new building has been erected and completed in accordance with the Buildings Act&#8217;s safety standards and regulations, as well as municipal legislation.\n\n\n\nHaryana (RERA) has issued laws requiring flats to be sold only based on carpet area\n\n\n\nOn April 27, 2021, the Haryana Real Estate Regulatory Authority (HARERA) announced that developers can only offer flats in their developments based on carpet area. The state RERA declared that the selling of apartments on a super area or any other bench would be considered deceptive and an unfair commercial activity, and that developers who violated these instructions would face penalties. \u201cIn real estate developments, the property is not correctly represented by stating the super area without precisely describing and breaking down the components contained in the super area. \u201cThe practice of selling real estate on a super area basis is deceptive, imprecise, opaque, and leads to misunderstanding and difficulties, as well as unnecessary litigation,\u201d stated KK Khandelwal, chairman of Haryana RERA.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\nSome of the key terms used in Real EstateRERA Carpet Area: Things You Must Know AboutCarpet area vs. built up area vs. super areaHow carpet area definition changes in RERABuilt up &amp; Super built up area\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n\n        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhat is the definition of carpet area?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe carpet area is the area of the house that may be occupied by a carpet, omitting the thickness of the interior walls.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhat is the formula for calculating carpet area?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you know the precise built-up area, you can determine the carpet area.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tAs per RERA, what is a carpet area?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs per the RERA, carpet area is defined as &#8220;a house&#8217;s net usable floor space.&#8221;                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhat is contained in the carpet area?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe space covered by exterior walls, spaces beneath services shafts, exclusive balcony or verandah area, and exclusive open terrace area are not included in the carpet area.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tHow can you figure out how much loading is on your carpet area?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf a developer uses a loading factor of 1.25, it implies that the carpet area of the flat has been increased by 2%.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t\nThe post Get Familiar With These Real-Estate Terms: Carpet Area, Built-Up Area and Super Built-Up Area appeared first on Real Estate News.",

            "content_html": "\n<h2 id=\"h-what-does-a-bhk-stand-for\"><strong>What does a BHK stand for?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">BHK is an abbreviation for bedroom, hall, and kitchen. It is used to communicate the number of bedrooms and other arrangements in a flat/property. BHK is utilized in the real estate division pretty frequently. It is simply a Bedroom, Hall, and Kitchen&#8217;s short-form like below:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>B = Bedroom<br>H = Hall<br>K = Kitchen</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Nowadays real estate market has classified/categorized all studios/flats as 1BHK, 2 BHK, 3 BHK, etc. like the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1BHK is 1 bedroom, hall, and kitchen<br>2BHK is 2 bedrooms, hall, and kitchen<br>3BHK is 3 bedrooms, hall, and kitchen<br>4BHK is 4 bedrooms, hall, and kitchen</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">When a person addresses a specific flat of an apartment as 1 BHK, the person is explaining that the flat/apartment has 1 Bedroom, 1 Hall, and 1 Kitchen respectively. Likewise, if a person labels a 2 BHK, the person is representing about 2 Bedrooms, 1 Hall, 1 Kitchen, and 3 Bedrooms, 1 Hall, 1 Kitchen each.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">A 3BHK arrangement indicates a flat pattern that has three bedrooms, one hall, and one kitchen in the apartment/flat.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-below-are-a-detailed-description-of-the-flat-or-tenement-arrangements\"><strong>Below are a detailed description of the flat or tenement arrangements</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>S.No.</strong></td><td><strong>Notation</strong></td><td><strong>Standard Size</strong></td><td><strong>BHK Full-Form Explanation</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1.</td><td>1 BHK</td><td>400 \u2013 500 sq.ft</td><td>1 Bedroom, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen Standard flat with 1 Bedroom, 1 Living Room and 1 Kitchen</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>2 BHK</td><td>850-1000 sq. ft&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>2 Bedroom, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen Typical flat with 2 Bedrooms, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen. 1 primary master Bedroom with a connected washroom and 1 Bedroom of the conventional size.</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>3 BHK</td><td>1200 \u2013 1500 sq. ft.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>3 Bedroom, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen Typical flat with 3 Bedrooms, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen. 2 Primary Master Bedrooms with connected washrooms and 1 Bedroom at regular size.</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>4 BHK</td><td>Above 2200 sq. ft&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>4 Bedroom, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen Typical flat with 3 Bedrooms, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen. 3 Primary Master Bedrooms with connected washrooms and 1 Bedroom at regular size.</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>2.5 BHK</td><td>Above 950 sq. ft&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>2.5 Bedroom, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen Standard flat with 2 regular measurement bedrooms, 0.5 signifies the bedroom size will be lesser than the standard size, so one can utilize it as a treasury or library as per our necessity.</td></tr><tr><td>6.</td><td>1 RK</td><td>400-500 sq. ft&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>1 Room &amp; 1 Kitchen Studio Apartments come under the category 1 room and 1 kitchen.

There are apartments on old-type constructions with the most extensive carpet area where 1RK is transformed into 1BHK by segregating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">As the full form implies, RK is Room and Kitchen. For instance, a 2 BHK, for the economy in property language, is associated with a 2 Bedroom Hall Kitchen. An RK has a room, washroom, and kitchen so it does not possess any complete wall divider to separate the house and it simply looks similar to a big room.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-is-a-penthouse\"><strong>What is a penthouse?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">A penthouse is a leisure apartment that is placed on the best, top-most floor of the arrangement. These flats have magnificent views of the horizon and the view gives a feeling of greatness to the inhabitants. The word \u2018penthouse\u2019 is basically referred to a smaller \u2018house\u2019 that was built on the rooftop of a building. Balconies and rooftop levels are the remarkable high point of penthouse flats/apartments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-is-a-studio-apartment\"><strong>What is a studio apartment?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">A studio apartment is a tiny apartment that connects several rooms, usually the hall, bedroom, and kitchen. These types of apartments regularly include one large room that usually works as the living, dining, and bedroom or may consist of a pretty small pad for a bedroom. The kitchen equipment may be placed in the middle room, or a tiny separate room, and the washroom is normally in a tiny space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The studio flat is an apartment with only one room. These apartments are also recognized as single-room residence rooms or studio apartments. They are also introduced as Efficiency Flats.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-difference-between-1bhk-and-1rk\"><strong>Difference between 1Bhk And 1RK</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The fundamental difference between 1Bhk And 1RK is that the hall is not present. One BHK is ideal for tiny and lower-middle-income families because it consists of a room, a hall, and an individual kitchen so the people will eventually turn the hall into a different room where the kids of the family can grow up. But in a 1RK, only a room and an individual kitchen are present with the absence of a hall that could be transformed into a different room for children, so it could be valid solely for the bachelors. BHK gives extra range while the RK is restricted and the price of BHK is more than RK but not too much, so it is recommended to have a BHK rather than having RK.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-bhk-usage\"><strong>BHK usage</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The full form of \u2018BHK\u2019 is utilized to apply to the arrangement and not simply flats but also in villas, independent tenements, builder floor homes, and cottages too. In the category of plots, the word \u2018BHK\u2019 is not relevant, except when someone is utilizing it to point to future arrangements. \u2013 for instance, \u2018You can construct a 3BHK residence on this land.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-is-the-0-5bhk-arrangement\"><strong>What is the 0.5BHK arrangement?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Constructors have been exploring different arrangements that are accepted by the home purchasers. For small households or individual professionals, this 0.5BHK might be adequate. It points to a flat arrangement that has a single bedroom that is somewhat tinier than a regular-sized bedroom, a washroom/bath, and a kitchen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-does-2-5bhk-mean\"><strong>What does 2.5BHK mean?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">A 2.5BHK arrangement consists of two rooms as well as a small room that can be utilized as a library or helper room. These kinds of arrangements are frequently converted to modern units, particularly in the regions like Delhi NCR. Medium-sized households, with four to five people, frequently choose these kinds of arrangements because it provides them the leisure of 3 BHK units at a comparatively cheaper price.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-to-comprehend-about-the-property-s-measurement\"><strong>What to comprehend about the property\u2019s measurement?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">If you estimate the lot dimensions of an estate you are fascinated with purchasing or marketing, you will surely understand specifically what you&#8217;re trading with. Understanding the lot dimension also permits you to know if later expansion is probable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The price of your estate depends on the actual size, or sq. footage, of your house and the land that it is placed on. You can discover the lot size of your real estate assets with manageable arithmetical calculations. Online tools that are free are great at obtaining your lot size falling to the sq. ft.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-lot-size-for-development\"><strong>Lot Size for Development</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">While you might be content with the lot measurement and your house, you might require to develop on the lot by joining either an outside shed or a stand-alone garage. The lot area of the estate also partially defines if you can develop the current buildings inside the property lines or attach new constructions on your land. Town codes and state laws are implemented, so constantly be informed of your regional codes and laws.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-to-obtain-the-property-lot-size\"><strong>How to Obtain the Property Lot Size</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">If you aren\u2019t certain regarding the lot size, yearly tax latest updates and additional state-generated data may give the lot measurement simultaneously with the other important information. The state records department in your town will own your primary lot size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">These are standard offices, so you can be assured that you know the accurate lot size to apply in any legal potential you may require.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-keeping-it-standard\"><strong>Keeping It Standard</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">If you want to determine lot dimensions for legitimate reasons or to market your assets, then you&#8217;ll be required to hold some necessary records in place. Be sure you possess the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Deed</li><li>Title report</li><li>Proper surveys that were hired by you or past buyers/sellers<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-to-understand-the-deed\"><strong>How to Understand the Deed</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The deed will include a summary of the resources and the measurement of all of the lot\u2019s edges. For a little fee, the state records department can print out a photocopy of the deed if you do not possess one on file. Or, you might be able to obtain it online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The property papers or preceding title report will constitute a scale plan that provides the capital and the enclosing lot borders. If the estate survey report was successfully finished, then it will additionally show the surrounding property lines, in more detail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The division assessor office\u2019s standard website may have an online photocopy of tax documents and lot sizes. This can save you money and time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-to-measure-the-lot-size\"><strong>How to Measure the Lot Size</strong><strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Once you have hunted down all the necessary papers, you should get down to the features and estimate the lot size. Plot out the edges of the estate on paper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Distribute the sketch that you have pulled into the most simplistic configurations that the original land lines provide. If you possess a square lot, distribute the drawings into a square. For an unevenly shaped lot like those observed in provincial or undeveloped commercial sectors, you can distribute the sketch of the property into an asymmetrical polygon into two triangles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Practice a roll-out mapping tool to estimate any unknown limits and write these figures down in the relevant area of the design. A roll-out mapping tool is official for mapping a land line. They are free online and can value around $5 to higher than $100.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">A roll-out mapping tool is a simplistic piece of tools that maximum landowners who have marked a property or other space on their homeland may be familiar with. It seems like a measuring tape on the edge of a stick along with the wheel. Unusual roll-out mapping tools are digital as well as handheld. To practice these, understand the directions and steps because every manufacturer has distinctive designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-measure-lot-size\"><strong>Measure Lot Size</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Rule rectangle and square lots and then simply multiply the width limits by the length.</li><li>To determine the area of a triangle-shaped lot, multiply the height of that particular triangle by its base and then divide the outcome by 2.</li><li>Sum up the area of all shapes to reach the total size of the lot.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Utilize these estimates to determine the area of the lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-you-might-also-like\">You Might Also Like</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-yoast-seo-related-links\"><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/tips-to-beautify-your-bedroom\">Tips to Beautify your bedroom</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/15-best-pop-ceiling-design-for-hall-with-2-fans\">15 Best Pop Ceiling Design for Hall with 2 Fans</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/average-sizes-of-apartments-come-down-by-27-in-5-years-the-definitive-moment-for-affordable-housing\">Average sizes of apartments come down by 27% in 5 years- The definitive moment for affordable housing</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/property-buyers-now-seek-bigger-apartments-major-indian-cities\">Property buyers now seek bigger apartments in major Indian cities</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/impact-demonetization-currency-notes-primary-real-estate-india\">Impact of Demonetization of Currency notes on Primary Real Estate in India</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-frequently-asked-questions-faqs\">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>\n\n\n        <section class=\"sc_fs_faq sc_card\">\n            <div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>How is BHK measured?</h2>                <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn simplistic terms, it is the whole area in one&#8217;s flat where one can place the carpet.

            "content_text": "What does a BHK stand for?\n\n\n\nBHK is an abbreviation for bedroom, hall, and kitchen. It is used to communicate the number of bedrooms and other arrangements in a flat/property. BHK is utilized in the real estate division pretty frequently. It is simply a Bedroom, Hall, and Kitchen&#8217;s short-form like below:\n\n\n\nB = BedroomH = HallK = Kitchen\n\n\n\nNowadays real estate market has classified/categorized all studios/flats as 1BHK, 2 BHK, 3 BHK, etc. like the following:\n\n\n\n1BHK is 1 bedroom, hall, and kitchen2BHK is 2 bedrooms, hall, and kitchen3BHK is 3 bedrooms, hall, and kitchen4BHK is 4 bedrooms, hall, and kitchen\n\n\n\nWhen a person addresses a specific flat of an apartment as 1 BHK, the person is explaining that the flat/apartment has 1 Bedroom, 1 Hall, and 1 Kitchen respectively. Likewise, if a person labels a 2 BHK, the person is representing about 2 Bedrooms, 1 Hall, 1 Kitchen, and 3 Bedrooms, 1 Hall, 1 Kitchen each.\n\n\n\nA 3BHK arrangement indicates a flat pattern that has three bedrooms, one hall, and one kitchen in the apartment/flat.\n\n\n\nBelow are a detailed description of the flat or tenement arrangements\n\n\n\nS.No.NotationStandard SizeBHK Full-Form Explanation1.1 BHK400 \u2013 500 sq.ft1 Bedroom, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen Standard flat with 1 Bedroom, 1 Living Room and 1 Kitchen2.2 BHK850-1000 sq. ft&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 Bedroom, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen Typical flat with 2 Bedrooms, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen. 1 primary master Bedroom with a connected washroom and 1 Bedroom of the conventional size.3.3 BHK1200 \u2013 1500 sq. ft.&nbsp;&nbsp;3 Bedroom, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen Typical flat with 3 Bedrooms, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen. 2 Primary Master Bedrooms with connected washrooms and 1 Bedroom at regular size.4.4 BHKAbove 2200 sq. ft&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 Bedroom, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen Typical flat with 3 Bedrooms, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen. 3 Primary Master Bedrooms with connected washrooms and 1 Bedroom at regular size.5.2.5 BHKAbove 950 sq. ft&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5 Bedroom, 1 Living Room &amp; 1 Kitchen Standard flat with 2 regular measurement bedrooms, 0.5 signifies the bedroom size will be lesser than the standard size, so one can utilize it as a treasury or library as per our necessity.6.1 RK400-500 sq. ft&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 Room &amp; 1 Kitchen Studio Apartments come under the category 1 room and 1 kitchen.

Simultaneously with 3 Shared Washrooms.Detailed description of the flat or tenement arrangements\n\n\n\nWhat is 1RK?\n\n\n\n1RK indicates just one room that connects a bedroom, washroom, and kitchen. There are apartments on old-type constructions with the most extensive carpet area where 1RK is transformed into 1BHK by segregating.\n\n\n\nAs the full form implies, RK is Room and Kitchen. For instance, a 2 BHK, for the economy in property language, is associated with a 2 Bedroom Hall Kitchen. An RK has a room, washroom, and kitchen so it does not possess any complete wall divider to separate the house and it simply looks similar to a big room.\n\n\n\nWhat is a penthouse?\n\n\n\nA penthouse is a leisure apartment that is placed on the best, top-most floor of the arrangement. These flats have magnificent views of the horizon and the view gives a feeling of greatness to the inhabitants. The word \u2018penthouse\u2019 is basically referred to a smaller \u2018house\u2019 that was built on the rooftop of a building. Balconies and rooftop levels are the remarkable high point of penthouse flats/apartments.\n\n\n\nWhat is a studio apartment?\n\n\n\nA studio apartment is a tiny apartment that connects several rooms, usually the hall, bedroom, and kitchen. These types of apartments regularly include one large room that usually works as the living, dining, and bedroom or may consist of a pretty small pad for a bedroom. The kitchen equipment may be placed in the middle room, or a tiny separate room, and the washroom is normally in a tiny space.\n\n\n\nThe studio flat is an apartment with only one room. These apartments are also recognized as single-room residence rooms or studio apartments. They are also introduced as Efficiency Flats.\n\n\n\nDifference between 1Bhk And 1RK\n\n\n\nThe fundamental difference between 1Bhk And 1RK is that the hall is not present. One BHK is ideal for tiny and lower-middle-income families because it consists of a room, a hall, and an individual kitchen so the people will eventually turn the hall into a different room where the kids of the family can grow up. But in a 1RK, only a room and an individual kitchen are present with the absence of a hall that could be transformed into a different room for children, so it could be valid solely for the bachelors. BHK gives extra range while the RK is restricted and the price of BHK is more than RK but not too much, so it is recommended to have a BHK rather than having RK.\n\n\n\nBHK usage\n\n\n\nThe full form of \u2018BHK\u2019 is utilized to apply to the arrangement and not simply flats but also in villas, independent tenements, builder floor homes, and cottages too. In the category of plots, the word \u2018BHK\u2019 is not relevant, except when someone is utilizing it to point to future arrangements. \u2013 for instance, \u2018You can construct a 3BHK residence on this land.\n\n\n\nWhat is the 0.5BHK arrangement?\n\n\n\nConstructors have been exploring different arrangements that are accepted by the home purchasers. For small households or individual professionals, this 0.5BHK might be adequate. It points to a flat arrangement that has a single bedroom that is somewhat tinier than a regular-sized bedroom, a washroom/bath, and a kitchen.\n\n\n\nWhat does 2.5BHK mean?\n\n\n\nA 2.5BHK arrangement consists of two rooms as well as a small room that can be utilized as a library or helper room. These kinds of arrangements are frequently converted to modern units, particularly in the regions like Delhi NCR. Medium-sized households, with four to five people, frequently choose these kinds of arrangements because it provides them the leisure of 3 BHK units at a comparatively cheaper price.\n\n\n\nWhat to comprehend about the property\u2019s measurement?\n\n\n\nIf you estimate the lot dimensions of an estate you are fascinated with purchasing or marketing, you will surely understand specifically what you&#8217;re trading with. Understanding the lot dimension also permits you to know if later expansion is probable.\n\n\n\nThe price of your estate depends on the actual size, or sq. footage, of your house and the land that it is placed on. You can discover the lot size of your real estate assets with manageable arithmetical calculations. Online tools that are free are great at obtaining your lot size falling to the sq. ft.\n\n\n\nLot Size for Development\n\n\n\nWhile you might be content with the lot measurement and your house, you might require to develop on the lot by joining either an outside shed or a stand-alone garage. The lot area of the estate also partially defines if you can develop the current buildings inside the property lines or attach new constructions on your land. Town codes and state laws are implemented, so constantly be informed of your regional codes and laws.\n\n\n\nHow to Obtain the Property Lot Size\n\n\n\nIf you aren\u2019t certain regarding the lot size, yearly tax latest updates and additional state-generated data may give the lot measurement simultaneously with the other important information. The state records department in your town will own your primary lot size.\n\n\n\nThese are standard offices, so you can be assured that you know the accurate lot size to apply in any legal potential you may require.\n\n\n\nKeeping It Standard\n\n\n\nIf you want to determine lot dimensions for legitimate reasons or to market your assets, then you&#8217;ll be required to hold some necessary records in place. Be sure you possess the following:\n\n\n\nDeedTitle reportProper surveys that were hired by you or past buyers/sellers&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow to Understand the Deed\n\n\n\nThe deed will include a summary of the resources and the measurement of all of the lot\u2019s edges. For a little fee, the state records department can print out a photocopy of the deed if you do not possess one on file. Or, you might be able to obtain it online.\n\n\n\nThe property papers or preceding title report will constitute a scale plan that provides the capital and the enclosing lot borders. If the estate survey report was successfully finished, then it will additionally show the surrounding property lines, in more detail.\n\n\n\nThe division assessor office\u2019s standard website may have an online photocopy of tax documents and lot sizes. This can save you money and time.\n\n\n\nHow to Measure the Lot Size\n\n\n\nOnce you have hunted down all the necessary papers, you should get down to the features and estimate the lot size. Plot out the edges of the estate on paper.\n\n\n\nDistribute the sketch that you have pulled into the most simplistic configurations that the original land lines provide. If you possess a square lot, distribute the drawings into a square. For an unevenly shaped lot like those observed in provincial or undeveloped commercial sectors, you can distribute the sketch of the property into an asymmetrical polygon into two triangles.\n\n\n\nPractice a roll-out mapping tool to estimate any unknown limits and write these figures down in the relevant area of the design. A roll-out mapping tool is official for mapping a land line. They are free online and can value around $5 to higher than $100.\n\n\n\nA roll-out mapping tool is a simplistic piece of tools that maximum landowners who have marked a property or other space on their homeland may be familiar with. It seems like a measuring tape on the edge of a stick along with the wheel. Unusual roll-out mapping tools are digital as well as handheld. To practice these, understand the directions and steps because every manufacturer has distinctive designs.\n\n\n\nMeasure Lot Size\n\n\n\nRule rectangle and square lots and then simply multiply the width limits by the length.To determine the area of a triangle-shaped lot, multiply the height of that particular triangle by its base and then divide the outcome by 2.Sum up the area of all shapes to reach the total size of the lot.\n\n\n\nUtilize these estimates to determine the area of the lot.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\nTips to Beautify your bedroom15 Best Pop Ceiling Design for Hall with 2 FansAverage sizes of apartments come down by 27% in 5 years- The definitive moment for affordable housingProperty buyers now seek bigger apartments in major Indian citiesImpact of Demonetization of Currency notes on Primary Real Estate in India\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n\n        \n            \n\t\t\t\tHow is BHK measured?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn simplistic terms, it is the whole area in one&#8217;s flat where one can place the carpet.

            "title": "Vastu Tips & Tricks For North-Facing Home",
            "content_html": "\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The very concept of Vastu Shastra came forward during the Vedic times in India, that is the science of space and architecture that guides the people to create spaces and environment that supports their physical, mental and spiritual health and paves the way for a prosperous life. Vastu Shastra is regarded as the science of designing and building houses, offices, temples, and other living spaces. Since ancient times, energy has been considered a free-flowing creation that can neither be created nor destroyed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">&nbsp;The transformation from one form to the other is possible. This free-flowing energy directs all the positive or negative vibes and thoughts within ourselves and our surroundings. Following the sets of rules and regulations of Vastu before entering any new place is mandatory to live a healthy and peaceful life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Referring to our auspicious Mythology and Vedas, Vastu Shastra indicates the directions- East and North to be most blessed with positive energies; hence, North-facing homes are the most auspicious ones.<strong> Vastu Shastra for North Facing Homes </strong>is widely accepted because of the presence of Lord Kuber, also known as the God of Wealth, in the North direction. It is not only the north-facing home that brings in prosperity but the whole North-facing house planin which every direction should be planned as per the Vastu. North Facing Home Vastu includes a complete list of directions for different corners of the house that needs to be followed to attract good positive energies. The list is as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Master Bedroom:</strong> Should face South-west region</li><li><strong>Pooja Room:</strong> Should be located in North-east region</li><li><strong>Living Room:</strong> Should face North-east region</li><li><strong>Guest Room:</strong> Should be in the North-west region</li><li><strong>Kitchen:</strong> Should lie in the South-east or North-west direction.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-about-north-facing-home\"><strong>About North Facing Home</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Briefly describing since the existence of humans, directions have played an essential role in assisting where, what and when to hunt, hide and migrate. Era&#8217;s changed, but directions still play a significant role in defining wealth and prosperity in human life; hence, the main entry gate of any house situated in the north direction is considered as North Facing Home that accounts for most positive energies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-are-north-facing-homes-good-or-bad\"><strong>Are North Facing Homes Good or Bad?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">It would not be fitting to conclude that only <strong>North Facing House Plans</strong> are the most appropriate and good ones, and the rest of the directions are not; rather, all the directions have their specialty, no direction is good or bad.

In some cases, if there is no choice to place the main door from first to the fifth pada, people may use sixth to the ninth pada to place the door.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Caution: </strong>It is advised that, due to the unavailability of any other pada for placement of the door, any individual tends to place the door at the fifth pada, they are advised to leave some space from the north-east corner.

            "content_text": "The very concept of Vastu Shastra came forward during the Vedic times in India, that is the science of space and architecture that guides the people to create spaces and environment that supports their physical, mental and spiritual health and paves the way for a prosperous life. Vastu Shastra is regarded as the science of designing and building houses, offices, temples, and other living spaces. Since ancient times, energy has been considered a free-flowing creation that can neither be created nor destroyed.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;The transformation from one form to the other is possible. This free-flowing energy directs all the positive or negative vibes and thoughts within ourselves and our surroundings. Following the sets of rules and regulations of Vastu before entering any new place is mandatory to live a healthy and peaceful life.\n\n\n\nReferring to our auspicious Mythology and Vedas, Vastu Shastra indicates the directions- East and North to be most blessed with positive energies; hence, North-facing homes are the most auspicious ones. Vastu Shastra for North Facing Homes is widely accepted because of the presence of Lord Kuber, also known as the God of Wealth, in the North direction. It is not only the north-facing home that brings in prosperity but the whole North-facing house planin which every direction should be planned as per the Vastu. North Facing Home Vastu includes a complete list of directions for different corners of the house that needs to be followed to attract good positive energies. The list is as follows:\n\n\n\nMaster Bedroom: Should face South-west regionPooja Room: Should be located in North-east regionLiving Room: Should face North-east regionGuest Room: Should be in the North-west regionKitchen: Should lie in the South-east or North-west direction.\n\n\n\nAbout North Facing Home\n\n\n\nBriefly describing since the existence of humans, directions have played an essential role in assisting where, what and when to hunt, hide and migrate. Era&#8217;s changed, but directions still play a significant role in defining wealth and prosperity in human life; hence, the main entry gate of any house situated in the north direction is considered as North Facing Home that accounts for most positive energies.\n\n\n\nAre North Facing Homes Good or Bad?\n\n\n\nIt would not be fitting to conclude that only North Facing House Plans are the most appropriate and good ones, and the rest of the directions are not; rather, all the directions have their specialty, no direction is good or bad. People need to follow specific guidelines of Vastu Shastra for North Facing Homes to attract prosperity to their homes.\n\n\n\nLocation of Main Gate in North Facing House Plan\n\n\n\nIn any house plan, there is always a special emphasis on the location of the main gate because it is the entrance point of the home from where either all negative or all the positive forces will enter the home. Hence its placement is the major area of concern. So, in a North Facing House Plan, the main gate should only be located in the North direction, the distance between north-east and north-west is divided into nine equal parts, where also the fifth step is the most auspicious among all because of the belief of the existence of God of Wealth there.\n\n\n\n987654321\u2191 Towards North\n\n\n\nImportance of Padas in Vastu Shastra\n\n\n\nAccording to the Vastu Shastra, a north-facing home is the most auspicious location as no pada situated in this direction is considered inauspicious. But to attract prosperity and well-being of the family members, people should follow the following tips:\n\n\n\nAs stated above, the fifth pada is considered the most auspicious among all the nine padas because of the presence of the Lord of wealth Kuber and determines the entrance of all the flow of energy in the house. Therefore, the main gate should always be placed in the fifth pada to attract wealth and prosperity to your home.\n\n\n\nIs there any alternative for placing the main door at the fifth pada?\n\n\n\nIn Vastu Shastra, it is advised that if due to any circumstances like size issue or anything else, the individual cannot place the main gate at fifth pada, then they may utilize first to the fourth pada particularly, and should not leave the fifth one. In some cases, if there is no choice to place the main door from first to the fifth pada, people may use sixth to the ninth pada to place the door.\n\n\n\nCaution: It is advised that, due to the unavailability of any other pada for placement of the door, any individual tends to place the door at the fifth pada, they are advised to leave some space from the north-east corner. The door must not touch this corner under any circumstances.\n\n\n\nIdeal North Facing House Plan\n\n\n\nWest Direction\n\n\n\nIdeal for:\n\n\n\nKids BedroomDining RoomStudy RoomStairs\n\n\n\nNorth-West Direction\n\n\n\nIdeal for:\n\n\n\nGuest BedroomKitchenLiving Room\n\n\n\nNorth Direction\n\n\n\nIdeal for:\n\n\n\nDrawing RoomLiving RoomOffice\n\n\n\nNorth-East Direction\n\n\n\nIdeal for:\n\n\n\nPuja Room\n\n\n\nNot Good for:\n\n\n\nGuardroom, storeroom, servant\u2019s room, generator, kitchen, bathroom, and stairs.\n\n\n\nEast Direction\n\n\n\nIdeal for:\n\n\n\nHallBalconyPorchVerandah\n\n\n\nSouth-East Direction\n\n\n\nIdeal for:\n\n\n\nBathroomKitchenStairs\n\n\n\nSouth Direction\n\n\n\nIdeal for:\n\n\n\nStairsOverhead Tank\n\n\n\nSouth-West Direction\n\n\n\nIdeal for:\n\n\n\nMaster BedroomGarageDresserWalk-in closetStairsBathroomStore\n\n\n\nPlacement Tips for North Facing Home Vastu\n\n\n\nSlope in a North Facing Home\n\n\n\nSince our ancient legends North direction has been considered highly auspicious as it attracts health and prosperity, therefore, it is advised that no north-facing house should have a slope existing in the North to south direction.\n\n\n\nKitchen\n\n\n\nIn a North-facing house plan, it is advised that the Kitchen should be located either in the southeast or northwest corners. However, the kitchen should never be placed in the northeast corner.\n\n\n\nNo trash accumulation\n\n\n\nAccording to the Vastu, it is advised that any garbage should not be accumulated in the North or northeast corner of the house, as they are the most auspicious corner of the house.\n\n\n\nTrees in a north-facing home\n\n\n\nIt is advised that no trees should be located on the north side of the home as it may become a barrier in attracting good energy to the house.\n\n\n\nPlacement of Holy items\n\n\n\nHoly items in every household are very auspicious, and their placement cannot be compromised. These items include religious symbols such as Swastika, Om, statues, paintings, etc., that cannot be kept anywhere and should be placed appropriately.\n\n\n\nElectricity circuit board\n\n\n\nThe electricity board should be placed in the southeast corner of the house because it is responsible for supplying electricity to the entire house. Placing the board in the southeast zone balances the distribution of energy.\n\n\n\nThe direction of septic tanks\n\n\n\nOne should never place the septic tank around or in the northeast direction.\n\n\n\nPlacement of Bedrooms and Toilets\n\n\n\nAccording to the Vastu of the bedroom, it is advised to construct them in the southwest region. Bathrooms and toilets should never be placed in the corners facing northeast.\n\n\n\nPooja room\n\n\n\nThe pooja room and living room should be placed in the northeast direction.\n\n\n\nGuest room\n\n\n\nA guest room should be in the northwest direction.\n\n\n\nGarage/car parking\n\n\n\nGarage or the parking space should be planned either in the southeast or northwest direction but should be avoided in the north direction as it may cause trouble with the family\u2019s mental peace.\n\n\n\nLevel of land in a north-facing home\n\n\n\nThe main area of concern of the level of the land is the north direction, i.e., the land should not be higher in the north direction, nor the north direction side of the house should be placed higher than the rest of the house. The level of the floors of the entire house should be on the same lower level. It is also believed that if the front portion of the house is on a lower level, then the central room will bring progress.\n\n\n\nHow to ensure luck in the north-facing home?\n\n\n\nAccording to the Vastu Shastra, it is claimed that a north-facing house is the best, and if it is extended to the northeast side, it may bring greater luck. Apartments located in the north direction are not a good idea, but the flow of energy can be regulated by placing an idol of Lord Kuber towards the north direction. Vastu also claims that placing a Tulsi plant in the North, Northeast, or East direction of the house converts any negative energy into positive and brings health and prosperity.\n\n\n\nStaircase placement in north-facing property\n\n\n\nFor the placement of any item or room in a house, a Vastu expert should always be contacted to make the house situated in the aura of positive vibes.\n\n\n\nHere are some quick guidelines to ensure effective placements in a house:\n\n\n\nStaircases should not be placed in the north direction to avoid any financial loss.For the staircase, south, west, southeast, southwest, and northwest directions are considered ideal.To avoid any nerve-related health issues, one should avoid placing staircases in the northeast direction.Staircases should be placed in a clockwise fashion.\n\n\n\nEffects on Women in a North Facing House Plan\n\n\n\nVastu Shastra states that wealth, health, and especially women are affected by the position of the house in a certain direction. Even a woman&#8217;s success is also linked to the house she is living in, so people should be aware of the tips by which they can correct all the Vastu-doshas.\n\n\n\nVastu states that the southeast corner is the home of the planet Venus, which is related to women, so the southeast corner of the house should follow the Vastu related terms; else, the working women or women in the house may face problems and struggles in life.There should be a provision of a well-lit area in the house if the main door or the bedroom door has entrances from the southeast corner.Placement of an open and wide water tank or source of water in the north face is considered helpful for the growth of women.Any damage in the southeast, northwest, or west zone of the house may cause severe health issues or an unsuccessful career for the women.\n\n\n\nWhich people should prefer a North Facing Home?\n\n\n\nPeople with their zodiac or rashi as Cancer, Scorpio, or Pisces find north-facing homes best suitable for them. Even for the people into professions like businesses or finance, such as chartered accountants, accountants, bankers, stock market traders, and investors. The broker finds that north-facing homes are beneficial in their growth. North-facing homes are also best for communication and e-service providers, tour and travel services, astrology and Vastu services, or those in the hospitality sector.\n\n\n\nNorth-facing homes good for Senior Citizens?\n\n\n\nIdeally, according to the Vastu Shastra, it is advised that the head of the family should reside in the southwest or south-facing room. If the head of the family is now retired and involved in spiritual or religious work, he must reside in the room facing North, northeast, and the east to attract prosperity and health.\n\n\n\nThings to avoid in a North Facing House plan\n\n\n\nFollowing are the points that an individual must avoid in their north-facing home:\n\n\n\nNever have the main entrance of the house placed in the northwest direction.No bedrooms, toilets, or kitchens should be placed in the northeast corner of the house.The wastewater runoff should not be located in the north or south direction.Never place the entrance door on the sixth pada.Never go for a north-facing property without looking for any other things that may or may not work in your favour.Gardening should not be done in the northwest direction.The underground tank should be placed in the northwest direction of the house.Never paint your house in red or shades of maroon.Septic tanks should not be located in the North, Northeast, or East direction of the house.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nSince our great mythologies, i.e., Mahabharata and Ramayana that are believed to have existed almost 3000-5000 years ago, the existence and belief in Vastu Shastra also came into power, which cannot be neglected at any cost. When things are placed according to the Vastu, good vibes, energy, and health are attracted, and if not, then many unimaginable, bad things do happen. So, one must always consult Vastu before buying any property and after shifting to a new property. According to Vastu Shastra, no direction is good or bad. Still, a north-facing property is considered most auspicious due to the belief of Lord Kuber. For any doshas, in the rest of the directions, many Vastu doshas tips are also there that help to attract positive energies in non-north-facing properties too.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\nNorth Facing House Vastu Plan for a Peaceful LifeReal Advice from a Real Woman Entrepreneur for Women to Start InvestingHow to Improve Vastu for a South-facing Home?West Facing House Vastu Plan &amp; TipsVastu for Flats &amp; Apartments: 15 Major signs to watch out for\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n\n        \n            \n\t\t\t\tIn which colors can we paint our north-facing home?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tNorth-facing homes can be painted in shades of blue, white, cream, or khaki.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhich corner is best for the placement of the Puja room?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe northeast corner is ideal for the placement of the Puja room in the house.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tFor the placement of things, which southwest direction is ideal?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tSouthwest direction is ideal for dressers, stores, or the placement of staircase.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhy are north-facing properties so popular?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tNorth facing is so popular because, according to our Vastu Shastra, it is believed that the god of wealth, Lord Kuber resides in the north direction, which brings wealth and prosperity to our lives.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t        \n            \n\t\t\t\tCan mirrors be placed in the south or southeast face of the property?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tNo, mirrors cannot be placed in the south or southeast face of the property.                    \n                \n            \n        \n\t\nThe post Vastu Tips &#038; Tricks For North-Facing Home appeared first on Real Estate News.",

Vastu experts tell us how to take advantage of the power of west-facing homes to make them more profitable for homeowners. Home purchasers may make unusual decisions to bring prosperity and positive energy into their homes. Some people, for instance, may only desire an east-facing residence, north-facing bedrooms, or perhaps an east-facing kid&#8217;s room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">In truth, west-facing residences are less desirable due to a prevalent misunderstanding that they are unfortunate and inauspicious. According to experts of Vastu Shastra for west-facing homes, all angles are equal yet come with specific restrictions that one should be aware of for positivity to flow freely in the home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Even if a lovely west-facing house is available, numerous real estate brokers or lucrative property advertising will try to persuade you to buy other properties. They frequently advertise such homes at a significantly higher price, claiming that they are in high demand. It is fairly unusual for people to believe and propagate rumours that a west-facing home brings bad luck and should be avoided. On the flip side, the reality is quite different than it actually is. Nevertheless, Square Yards is here to burst these misconceptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">According to Indian Vastu gurus, each direction has its meaning and is equally fortunate. So, ensure that the property is Vastu compliant. It will help you and your family have a happy and wealthy life ahead. Today, we will dig deep into the significance of the Vastu designs for west-facing homes. So, stay connected with us as we investigate why you should not dismiss a magnificent west-facing house just based on misconceptions and rumours. So, let&#8217;s get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-is-a-west-facing-house\">What is a West-facing house?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">A residence or apartment is termed west-facing if the main entrance faces west. Normally, west-facing residences are not considered auspicious, but Vastu experts disagree. West-facing residences&#8217; main entrances should be somewhat to the north-west or in the center. When it comes to the main door, the southwest approach should be avoided at all costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The 5th and 6th pada will be the finest for the main door if you split the lengths from the northwest angle to the west corner into nine equal sections or pada, with the first in one in the west and the ninth one in the southwest. The seventh, eighth, as well as ninth padas should not be used for the entry since they are regarded as the devil&#8217;s energy corner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Nevertheless, as per Vastu Shastra, all dwellings are regarded equally auspicious. Therefore west-facing homes are no less fortunate than north or east-facing ones. If certain Vastu Shastra principles are followed, a west-facing home can be as wealthy as other dwellings. In this blog, we will look at the benefits of choosing a west-facing apartment as well as the Vastu principles to follow while building a west-facing home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">According to the real convictions of the intellectual movement of Vastu Shastra, all dwellings, whether they are north, east, west, as well as south-facing, are regarded equally fortunate if they are built according to Vastu Shastra design concepts. According to Vastu Shastra, the orientation of the dwelling has no bearing. It all depends on where the house&#8217;s primary entrance or door is located.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-is-there-any-benefit\">Is there any benefit?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Homes with west-facing doors, however, according to Japanese house design principles, exude youth and enthusiasm. West-facing doors are said to let more energy into the dwelling. As a result, all traditional Geisha residences in Japan have their main entrance facing west. Folks who reside in west-facing residences are seen to be affluent and have a large social circle. They will have no adversaries and will be adored by everyone at work, relationships, and social contexts. Lawmakers, teachers, religious figures, and entrepreneurs benefit from living in residences with a west-facing orientation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The kids&#8217; room in a west-facing house might be located on the south or western side, while the guest room can be located on the northwest. However, according to Vastu, the pooja room and sitting room should be at the northeast quadrant of the home, as it is the most fortunate corner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The main bedroom should be oriented to the southwest. Your master bedroom must be on the upper floor of a multi-level home. Choose the east side for your kitchen. According to Vastu, the kitchen must not be placed immediately under or above the pooja room, bedrooms, or toilet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The main benefit of a west-facing home is that you can enjoy the brightness and brilliance of the setting sun until dusk. Some people believe that a home facing the west will bring them more prosperity and fortune. They will have no adversaries and will be popular at work and also in social situations. Politicians, business entrepreneurs, teachers, and spiritual figures are said to prefer residences with a west-facing orientation. It is also said to be beneficial to children since it provides them with energy and happiness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">You may have noticed that having a house that faces west or north is unattractive or brings bad omen, and so on. But much like any other property, you may employ Vastu principles to make a west-facing house fortunate. The west is not considered an unfavourable direction in Vastu Shastra. In fact, according to Vastu Shastra, any orientation is excellent for a home. However, the position of the entry or main door is the determining element in Vastu for your property.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">There is a popular misconception that west-facing dwellings are Vastu-defying, but this isn&#8217;t true. West-facing houses rank below north-and east-facing buildings in terms of auspiciousness, but they are not unlucky. In fact, Vastu principles claim that the West-facing homes offer profits and financial and non-financial advantages.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-vastu-tips-for-your-west-facing-house\">Vastu Tips for your West-facing House</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>As per Vastu Shastra, it is critical for homeowners developing or purchasing new homes to establish a clear door situated within the appropriate &#8216;padas&#8217; or steps. The number of padas is calculated by dividing the house into nine equal sections, starting at the northwest corner, and working southward. In west-facing residences, the fourth, third, fifth, and sixth padas are the most auspicious for main entrances because they bring optimism and pleasant feelings. If the earlier in this thread padas are unavailable, the main door might be placed on padas one and two, which are neither excellent nor bad.</li><li>The kitchen is the main house engine and a source of good health and happiness for everyone who lives there. Therefore, Vastu adherents must construct their kitchens in the proper orientation. The kitchen should be in the eastern part or southeast part of the home, according to Vastu shastra. It is claimed that doing so guarantees that a kitchen&#8217;s positive charm is at its peak.</li><li>According to Vastu principles, the master bedroom should be in the house&#8217;s southern part. As a result, if the property has more than one story, the master bedroom should preferably be on the top floor. For bedrooms, there is a greater variety of direction options. As a result, they can be placed on the building&#8217;s south, west, or western most sides. It is preferable to have your master bedroom on the southwest side of the house. This orientation helps in increasing communication between couples in the room. If you have a multi-story home, the master bedroom should be on the top floor. This would bring prosperity, peace, and ancestral benefits to your household.</li><li>According to Vastu principles, private pools, storage tanks, and water submersible pumps should not be erected towards the west. Open areas should be located on the Eastern side of the building, away from the Western direction.</li><li>Colors like white, silvery, yellowish, and beige are most suited for west-facing houses, as per Vastu principles. Furthermore, it is claimed that these colours increase earnings and benefits from the Western direction. On the other hand, the home is oriented more towards the West than other directions, a lighter shade of blue can be employed to take advantage of the direction&#8217;s advantages. Off-white as well as creams are Vastu-neutral colors, making them safe choices when faced with a color palette.</li><li>Make sure your primary door entry is in the Midwest or Northwest corner of your house. Metalwork, such as a metallic name board or a metallic bell should be designed for your west-facing entrance. Maintain a detritus main entry area. Remove any trash cans or damaged furniture from the area around the entrance door.</li><li>The first and best step is to establish whether you have a property that faces west. Determining the same might be difficult because many people believe that the setting sun is in the west. The precise west direction, on the other hand, fluctuates year to year. You can establish the precise west side in only two days every year.</li><li>The temple, also known as a pooja room, is a sacred space where you may harness all of the divine forces surrounding you. The northeast direction is the most energetic zone in a west-facing home; therefore, it makes complete sense to put it in this corner. However, not every home has the necessary space to have a separate pooja room. If your lounge room does not have enough space for this, you can position your living room inside the north and a tiny temple or pooja stand inside the north part.</li><li>While verifying the directional face of the property, use a magnetic compass to trace the precise west.</li><li>Make sure the current house&#8217;s main entrance is only in the third or fourth padas.</li><li>Build the walls mainly on the south and west sides of the building- a bit thicker and taller than those on the east and north sides.</li><li>Place your living room as well as the Pooja room at the northeast corner of the house, as this is the most auspicious part of the house.</li><li>If you don&#8217;t have a pooja room, install the temple inside the living room&#8217;s north part.</li><li>Make sure the kid&#8217;s room is facing either west, south, or north-west.</li><li>If your plot is slanted, ensure that it is slanted from south to north.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-things-you-must-avoid\">Things you must avoid</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Avoid using the setting sun to discover the precise west direction.</li><li>Except for the ones listed, avoid all other padas unless you visit a Vastu specialist beforehand.</li><li>Avoid buying land with a north-to-south slope since it may result in financial losses.</li><li>Avoid buying a parcel of land or a house with a southwest or south direction expansion.</li><li>A bore well, a storage tank or a sump should not be located in the southwest corner of a west-facing residence.</li><li>A kitchen should not be placed in the house&#8217;s southwest corner.</li><li>Sleeping beneath a beam or a wall divider is not a good idea.</li><li>Make sure your legs aren&#8217;t pointed towards the bedroom door as you sleep.</li><li>Purchase a property with a South and West border that is thinner than the East and North boundaries.</li><li>Avoid any home with the main entrance blocked by a huge item such as a tree or an electric pole.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-conclusion\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">As can be seen, the Vastu of west facing property is just as excellent as any other Vastu. All you have to do now is make sure you follow all of the Vastu regulations. If you are building a house on a plot, it is rather simple.

            "content_text": "West-facing residences are considered unlucky due to preconceived notions. Vastu experts tell us how to take advantage of the power of west-facing homes to make them more profitable for homeowners. Home purchasers may make unusual decisions to bring prosperity and positive energy into their homes. Some people, for instance, may only desire an east-facing residence, north-facing bedrooms, or perhaps an east-facing kid&#8217;s room.\n\n\n\nIn truth, west-facing residences are less desirable due to a prevalent misunderstanding that they are unfortunate and inauspicious. According to experts of Vastu Shastra for west-facing homes, all angles are equal yet come with specific restrictions that one should be aware of for positivity to flow freely in the home.\n\n\n\nEven if a lovely west-facing house is available, numerous real estate brokers or lucrative property advertising will try to persuade you to buy other properties. They frequently advertise such homes at a significantly higher price, claiming that they are in high demand. It is fairly unusual for people to believe and propagate rumours that a west-facing home brings bad luck and should be avoided. On the flip side, the reality is quite different than it actually is. Nevertheless, Square Yards is here to burst these misconceptions.\n\n\n\nAccording to Indian Vastu gurus, each direction has its meaning and is equally fortunate. So, ensure that the property is Vastu compliant. It will help you and your family have a happy and wealthy life ahead. Today, we will dig deep into the significance of the Vastu designs for west-facing homes. So, stay connected with us as we investigate why you should not dismiss a magnificent west-facing house just based on misconceptions and rumours. So, let&#8217;s get started.\n\n\n\nWhat is a West-facing house?\n\n\n\nA residence or apartment is termed west-facing if the main entrance faces west. Normally, west-facing residences are not considered auspicious, but Vastu experts disagree. West-facing residences&#8217; main entrances should be somewhat to the north-west or in the center. When it comes to the main door, the southwest approach should be avoided at all costs.\n\n\n\nThe 5th and 6th pada will be the finest for the main door if you split the lengths from the northwest angle to the west corner into nine equal sections or pada, with the first in one in the west and the ninth one in the southwest. The seventh, eighth, as well as ninth padas should not be used for the entry since they are regarded as the devil&#8217;s energy corner.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, as per Vastu Shastra, all dwellings are regarded equally auspicious. Therefore west-facing homes are no less fortunate than north or east-facing ones. If certain Vastu Shastra principles are followed, a west-facing home can be as wealthy as other dwellings. In this blog, we will look at the benefits of choosing a west-facing apartment as well as the Vastu principles to follow while building a west-facing home.\n\n\n\nAccording to the real convictions of the intellectual movement of Vastu Shastra, all dwellings, whether they are north, east, west, as well as south-facing, are regarded equally fortunate if they are built according to Vastu Shastra design concepts. According to Vastu Shastra, the orientation of the dwelling has no bearing. It all depends on where the house&#8217;s primary entrance or door is located.\n\n\n\nIs there any benefit?\n\n\n\nHomes with west-facing doors, however, according to Japanese house design principles, exude youth and enthusiasm. West-facing doors are said to let more energy into the dwelling. As a result, all traditional Geisha residences in Japan have their main entrance facing west. Folks who reside in west-facing residences are seen to be affluent and have a large social circle. They will have no adversaries and will be adored by everyone at work, relationships, and social contexts. Lawmakers, teachers, religious figures, and entrepreneurs benefit from living in residences with a west-facing orientation.\n\n\n\nThe kids&#8217; room in a west-facing house might be located on the south or western side, while the guest room can be located on the northwest. However, according to Vastu, the pooja room and sitting room should be at the northeast quadrant of the home, as it is the most fortunate corner.\n\n\n\nThe main bedroom should be oriented to the southwest. Your master bedroom must be on the upper floor of a multi-level home. Choose the east side for your kitchen. According to Vastu, the kitchen must not be placed immediately under or above the pooja room, bedrooms, or toilet.\n\n\n\nThe main benefit of a west-facing home is that you can enjoy the brightness and brilliance of the setting sun until dusk. Some people believe that a home facing the west will bring them more prosperity and fortune. They will have no adversaries and will be popular at work and also in social situations. Politicians, business entrepreneurs, teachers, and spiritual figures are said to prefer residences with a west-facing orientation. It is also said to be beneficial to children since it provides them with energy and happiness.\n\n\n\nYou may have noticed that having a house that faces west or north is unattractive or brings bad omen, and so on. But much like any other property, you may employ Vastu principles to make a west-facing house fortunate. The west is not considered an unfavourable direction in Vastu Shastra. In fact, according to Vastu Shastra, any orientation is excellent for a home. However, the position of the entry or main door is the determining element in Vastu for your property.\n\n\n\nThere is a popular misconception that west-facing dwellings are Vastu-defying, but this isn&#8217;t true. West-facing houses rank below north-and east-facing buildings in terms of auspiciousness, but they are not unlucky. In fact, Vastu principles claim that the West-facing homes offer profits and financial and non-financial advantages.\n\n\n\nVastu Tips for your West-facing House\n\n\n\nAs per Vastu Shastra, it is critical for homeowners developing or purchasing new homes to establish a clear door situated within the appropriate &#8216;padas&#8217; or steps. The number of padas is calculated by dividing the house into nine equal sections, starting at the northwest corner, and working southward. In west-facing residences, the fourth, third, fifth, and sixth padas are the most auspicious for main entrances because they bring optimism and pleasant feelings. If the earlier in this thread padas are unavailable, the main door might be placed on padas one and two, which are neither excellent nor bad.The kitchen is the main house engine and a source of good health and happiness for everyone who lives there. Therefore, Vastu adherents must construct their kitchens in the proper orientation. The kitchen should be in the eastern part or southeast part of the home, according to Vastu shastra. It is claimed that doing so guarantees that a kitchen&#8217;s positive charm is at its peak.According to Vastu principles, the master bedroom should be in the house&#8217;s southern part. As a result, if the property has more than one story, the master bedroom should preferably be on the top floor. For bedrooms, there is a greater variety of direction options. As a result, they can be placed on the building&#8217;s south, west, or western most sides. It is preferable to have your master bedroom on the southwest side of the house. This orientation helps in increasing communication between couples in the room. If you have a multi-story home, the master bedroom should be on the top floor. This would bring prosperity, peace, and ancestral benefits to your household.According to Vastu principles, private pools, storage tanks, and water submersible pumps should not be erected towards the west. Open areas should be located on the Eastern side of the building, away from the Western direction.Colors like white, silvery, yellowish, and beige are most suited for west-facing houses, as per Vastu principles. Furthermore, it is claimed that these colours increase earnings and benefits from the Western direction. On the other hand, the home is oriented more towards the West than other directions, a lighter shade of blue can be employed to take advantage of the direction&#8217;s advantages. Off-white as well as creams are Vastu-neutral colors, making them safe choices when faced with a color palette.Make sure your primary door entry is in the Midwest or Northwest corner of your house. Metalwork, such as a metallic name board or a metallic bell should be designed for your west-facing entrance. Maintain a detritus main entry area. Remove any trash cans or damaged furniture from the area around the entrance door.The first and best step is to establish whether you have a property that faces west. Determining the same might be difficult because many people believe that the setting sun is in the west. The precise west direction, on the other hand, fluctuates year to year. You can establish the precise west side in only two days every year.The temple, also known as a pooja room, is a sacred space where you may harness all of the divine forces surrounding you. The northeast direction is the most energetic zone in a west-facing home; therefore, it makes complete sense to put it in this corner. However, not every home has the necessary space to have a separate pooja room. If your lounge room does not have enough space for this, you can position your living room inside the north and a tiny temple or pooja stand inside the north part.While verifying the directional face of the property, use a magnetic compass to trace the precise west.Make sure the current house&#8217;s main entrance is only in the third or fourth padas.Build the walls mainly on the south and west sides of the building- a bit thicker and taller than those on the east and north sides.Place your living room as well as the Pooja room at the northeast corner of the house, as this is the most auspicious part of the house.If you don&#8217;t have a pooja room, install the temple inside the living room&#8217;s north part.Make sure the kid&#8217;s room is facing either west, south, or north-west.If your plot is slanted, ensure that it is slanted from south to north.\n\n\n\nThings you must avoid\n\n\n\nAvoid using the setting sun to discover the precise west direction.Except for the ones listed, avoid all other padas unless you visit a Vastu specialist beforehand.Avoid buying land with a north-to-south slope since it may result in financial losses.Avoid buying a parcel of land or a house with a southwest or south direction expansion.A bore well, a storage tank or a sump should not be located in the southwest corner of a west-facing residence.A kitchen should not be placed in the house&#8217;s southwest corner.Sleeping beneath a beam or a wall divider is not a good idea.Make sure your legs aren&#8217;t pointed towards the bedroom door as you sleep.Purchase a property with a South and West border that is thinner than the East and North boundaries.Avoid any home with the main entrance blocked by a huge item such as a tree or an electric pole.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nAs can be seen, the Vastu of west facing property is just as excellent as any other Vastu. All you have to do now is make sure you follow all of the Vastu regulations. If you are building a house on a plot, it is rather simple. However, if you are moving to a flat or apartment, you may face several difficulties. It is frequently impossible to carry out a remodel that necessitates structural changes.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\nHow to Improve Vastu for a South-facing Home?Vastu for Flats &amp; Apartments: 15 Major signs to watch out forNorth Facing House Vastu Plan for a Peaceful LifeWest Facing House Vastu Plan &amp; TipsWest Facing House Vastu Plan\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n\n        \n            \n\t\t\t\tWhere is the sun from a west-facing house?                \n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom mid-evening to sunset, west-facing residences receive sunshine.

Demand has improved a little since the month of June and for those seeking to purchase a home for end-use, experts feel that this is the best possible time.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Demand is steadily coming back to the market. In some business sectors like IT, employees have garnered decent bonuses and salary hikes even for FY2020-21 and with projected 8.5-10% of economic growth in 2021-22, purchasing power may be enhanced more. The current hybrid working model may continue, prompting many buyers to switch from rented apartments in prime locations near their offices to their own homes on the periphery of major cities. Some are also upgrading to bigger housing units with ample space for setting up a home office. Some property platforms have confirmed that 35-40% of buyers are seeking to upgrade their homes. Real estate prices have mostly remained static or corrected in major markets with some markets witnessing only slim 2-3% gains annually for more than 8 years. The chances of prices falling downwards after a prolonged downward spiral are very less as per industry experts.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Several developers have already revised pricing since commodity costs have gone up for them, spurring higher input expenditure. New projects will automatically account for these extra costs and be priced at higher rates. Multi-year lows in ready to move inventory in cities like Mumbai and Delhi indicates clear buyer preference in this category. Principal Partner &amp; Director Sales at Square Yards, <strong>Kapil Malhotra</strong>, feels that prices may inch upwards if recovery happens smoothly. Home loan interest rates are already at their lowest thresholds. After Maharashtra\u2019s example, even West Bengal has reduced stamp duty and circle rates. The Delhi Government has also lowered circle rates till 30</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">th</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> September, 2021. These new developments may reduce buyer costs even further.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Malhotra opines that Grade A developers may not always offer discounts on properties although buyers may still be able to negotiate 8-10% discounts from Grade B and Grade C developers although these may withdraw with a pick-up in demand.

            "content_text": "Residential real estate sales figures were steady between January and March, 2021 although they fell in the quarter between April and June, with the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic leading to countrywide lockdowns. Demand has improved a little since the month of June and for those seeking to purchase a home for end-use, experts feel that this is the best possible time.&nbsp;\nDemand is steadily coming back to the market. In some business sectors like IT, employees have garnered decent bonuses and salary hikes even for FY2020-21 and with projected 8.5-10% of economic growth in 2021-22, purchasing power may be enhanced more. The current hybrid working model may continue, prompting many buyers to switch from rented apartments in prime locations near their offices to their own homes on the periphery of major cities. Some are also upgrading to bigger housing units with ample space for setting up a home office. Some property platforms have confirmed that 35-40% of buyers are seeking to upgrade their homes. Real estate prices have mostly remained static or corrected in major markets with some markets witnessing only slim 2-3% gains annually for more than 8 years. The chances of prices falling downwards after a prolonged downward spiral are very less as per industry experts.&nbsp;\nSeveral developers have already revised pricing since commodity costs have gone up for them, spurring higher input expenditure. New projects will automatically account for these extra costs and be priced at higher rates. Multi-year lows in ready to move inventory in cities like Mumbai and Delhi indicates clear buyer preference in this category. Principal Partner &amp; Director Sales at Square Yards, Kapil Malhotra, feels that prices may inch upwards if recovery happens smoothly. Home loan interest rates are already at their lowest thresholds. After Maharashtra\u2019s example, even West Bengal has reduced stamp duty and circle rates. The Delhi Government has also lowered circle rates till 30th September, 2021. These new developments may reduce buyer costs even further.&nbsp;\nMalhotra opines that Grade A developers may not always offer discounts on properties although buyers may still be able to negotiate 8-10% discounts from Grade B and Grade C developers although these may withdraw with a pick-up in demand. Some realty players are still providing 9:91 or 20:80 payment plans although the quantum of offers is much lower. Many peripheral zones are also benefiting from the advent of metro railway connectivity and several new areas are emerging as favored destinations in cities like Hyderabad and Bengaluru where rates are still attractive.&nbsp;\nExperts feel that buying for end-use is only advisable if there is low income risk and the buyer is certain that he/she will reside in a particular area with family for a minimum of 10 years.

            "content_html": "\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Societies are often stringent about keeping accurate records and paperwork. The managing committees of a housing society have the key responsibility of ensuring that all the proof of sale towards the property is rightfully issued. A<strong>&nbsp;share certificate</strong>, quite like the sale deed is proper proof that the rightful owner of the said property must possess.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Sometimes,&nbsp;<strong>housing society members&nbsp;</strong>tend to overlook or forget to issue these share certificates to the members which can be a problem in case a property-related issue occurs. While the sale deed does act as proof that you are the official owner of the property, a share certificate is legal proof of the same and is indispensable. The managing committee must ensure you have this but in case you do not have one, you can obtain one with ease.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-is-a-share-certificate\"><strong>What is a Share Certificate?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">In simple terms, a&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>&nbsp;is a legal document or certification provided by a cooperative&nbsp;<strong>housing society</strong>&nbsp;to the registered owner of the flat. This is given to the member at no cost and ideally, should be given within six months from the time of&nbsp;<strong>allotment of the shares in the housing society&nbsp;</strong>as per the number of shares subscribed by him/her. This share certificate is an active proof of ownership and should have the name of the said housing society, a distinctive number, number of shares allotted to the member as well as value paid after that. The&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>&nbsp;is free, and the registrar then decided the total authorized value at the time the society has been registered. In an event that the member has cleared all his or her dues and no other hitches are existing, the denial of a share certificate can entitle the member to take legal action against the cooperative&nbsp;<strong>housing society</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-why-do-you-need-a-share-certificate\"><strong>Why do you need a Share Certificate?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">A&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>&nbsp;is an indispensable document that solely acts as actual legal proof of ownership to the property and the shareholding within the society. The sale deed is also an important document, but the share certificate trumps that in case of official demand. This answer the question of&nbsp;<strong>what is a share certificate and why do you need it</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-a-checklist-for-the-issuance-of-a-share-certificate\"><strong>A Checklist for the Issuance of a Share Certificate&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>What to check before/after getting a share certificate&nbsp;</strong>is stated below and should be well kept in mind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>&nbsp;must be collected by the member in person himself/herself.&nbsp;</li><li>There should be no dues or penalties on the member&#8217;s property. In case there are any, they should be immediately paid up.&nbsp;</li><li>An important document called the &#8216;conveyance deed&#8217; that is issued by the builder should be in the possession of the&nbsp;<strong>housing society</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>The&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>&nbsp;should be signed by the secretary, chairman, and any other member of the managing committee along with the official seal of the&nbsp;<strong>housing society</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>The share certificate should be authorized by the managing committee first and only then issued by the secretary.&nbsp;</li><li>The housing society will demand that you give an<strong>&nbsp;indemnity bond</strong>&nbsp;which means that under no circumstances should the allotted shares be transferred to any individual or entity for any purpose whatsoever.&nbsp;</li><li>The names on the&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>&nbsp;should be exactly in the same order as it appears on the original sale agreement between the builder and the member. This includes primary as well as associate members.&nbsp;</li><li>The member will need to indemnify the cooperative housing society against any loans and complete any incomplete paperwork before the&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>&nbsp;can be issued.&nbsp;</li><li>No typos or spelling errors should be there in the name and other content on the sale deed. With this you can stay away from any issues that can arrive in future.</li><li>While collecting the&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>, the member will need to present the original sale deed.&nbsp;</li><li>Ensure that after you collect the&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>, all the required signatures as per the society members, official seal, etc. are present on it.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-transferring-of-share-certificate-in-case-of-resale\"><strong>Transferring of Share Certificate in Case of Resale</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Certain norms need to be followed in case of a resale. In such a scenario, the original&nbsp;<strong>share certificate&nbsp;</strong>will have to be given to the housing society along with any other documents as needed. In case the share certificate is being transferred in the name of the new member of the housing society after the resale, all procedures about the transfer of the share certificate will need to be made prior to any finalization. The following mentioned points should be kept in mind under such a circumstance.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The new member will need to pay the premium for the transfer of the share certificate.&nbsp;</li><li>The new member will have to make sure that all dues should be cleared by the previous owner of the property.&nbsp;</li><li>The new member will need to produce all the documents and necessary applications required by the&nbsp;<strong>housing society</strong>. These documents and applications should be in mint condition.&nbsp;</li><li>In an event that the original member dies, his or her consequent heirs will have to make an application for the share transfer to the appointed nominee and a new share certificate will have to be obtained.&nbsp;</li><li>The new share certificate should be issued by the cooperative&nbsp;<strong>housing society</strong>&nbsp;within the stipulated time, a lack of which can allow the member to take necessary legal action.</li><li>Readymade&nbsp;<strong>share certificate&nbsp;</strong>booklets are readily available online. Moreover, you can get them at book printing agencies as well as housing federation offices.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-issuance-of-a-duplicate-share-certificate\"><strong>Issuance of a Duplicate Share Certificate&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Just as in the case of any important document, it is advisable to keep the original copy of the&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>&nbsp;in a safe place and a proper condition. If you damage or lose this, getting a duplicate is not a simple task. However, it is difficult but not impossible. You can request the&nbsp;<strong>housing society members</strong>&nbsp;to issue you a new one and for this, you will need to follow the steps mentioned below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Step 1</strong>&nbsp;\u2013 The very first thing you will need to do is visit the local police station within your jurisdiction and file an FIR. You will need to add all the details in a registering report that will include details of whether the certificate is lost, damaged, misplaced, stolen, etc. Once this is done, you will need to retain the FIR acknowledgment by the police as you will need it for future communication and reference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Step 2</strong>&nbsp;\u2013 Once the FIR is complete, you will then need to inform the housing society members of this mishap. For this, you will be required to send a written application to them in which you will request them to issue you a new duplicate share certificate. This application will also need to have the details of what happened to the original copy. (i.e whether it is stolen, lost, misplaced, damaged, untraceable, etc.) You will also need to attach the FIR acknowledgment copy that you will have received after filing the FIR. (First Information Report).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Step 3&nbsp;</strong>\u2013 After step 2, you will need to submit an&nbsp;<strong>indemnity bond</strong>&nbsp;of Rs. 200 to the cooperative housing society. This will clear the society of all costs resulting due to the issuance of the new duplicate&nbsp;<strong>share certificate</strong>. All costs that arise for this procedure will have to be borne by the member himself/herself. Make sure that this indemnity bond is officially notarized and attach the FIR acknowledgment copy along with it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Step 4 \u2013&nbsp;</strong>Once the above-mentioned steps are complete, the managing committee will then review your application along with all the attached paperwork in the next general body meeting in which they will decide whether they want to approve or disapprove your request.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Step 5 \u2013&nbsp;</strong>If your request is approved, the housing society will then display a notice on the main notice board of the society so that all other members can have a look. Additionally, the society will also publish notices in at least two newspapers. All of this will be in regards to the issuing of a duplicate share certificate, the cost of which will need to be paid by the applicant.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Step 6 \u2013&nbsp;</strong>You along with the society will have to wait for a minimum of 15 days to see if any objections are made.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><strong>Step 7 \u2013&nbsp;</strong>If everything goes smoothly, and no objections are made, the housing society will then issue a new duplicate share certificate to you which you will have to collect in person when ready.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">So if you have lost or misplaced your original copy and are asking yourself, &#8216;<strong>Can I get a duplicate one?</strong>&#8221; the above-mentioned procedure will help you with the same.\u00a0 The ownership of a share certificate is extremely important for a property owner in a cooperative housing society. It does not only act as a legal document for your rights but also proves the allotment of shares of that society in your name. Without this share certificate, you can face issues in the future such as transferring the property to the rightful heirs, involvement or rights in any social events, police aid in case of crime, and many other such issues that may occur. Fortunately, even if the<strong>\u00a0housing society</strong>\u00a0has forgotten to issue this share certificate to you, you can now get it at any time from them. This article has dotted all the i&#8217;s and cross all the t&#8217;s with its information on the importance of a share certificate. If you have your original copy, ensure you keep it safe and in case you don&#8217;t, go and get it today!\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-you-might-also-like\">You Might Also Like</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-yoast-seo-related-links\"><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/cooperative-housing-society\">Cooperative Housing Society: Pros and Cons of Residing in it</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/society-maintenance-charges-maharashtra\">Society Maintenance charges in Maharashtra: Your handy calculation blueprint</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/5-important-real-estate-documents-worth-keeping-and-why\">5 Important Real Estate Documents Worth Keeping and Why</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/best-societies-in-noida\">5 Best Societies in Noida</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.squareyards.com/blog/year-ender-2020-revisit-the-top-regulatory-policies-of-2020\">Year Ender 2020: Revisit the Top Regulatory Policies of 2020</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-frequently-asked-questions-faqs\">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>\n\n\n        <section class=\"sc_fs_faq sc_card\">\n            <div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>In case I request for a duplicate certificate and objections are raised, what happens then?</h2>                <div>\n\t\t\t\t\t                    <p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnfortunately, the issuance of a duplicate share certificate is not as easy as getting the original one.

While the sale deed does act as proof that you are the official owner of the property, a share certificate is legal proof of the same and is indispensable. The managing committee must ensure you have this but in case you do not have one, you can obtain one with ease.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat is a Share Certificate?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn simple terms, a&nbsp;share certificate&nbsp;is a legal document or certification provided by a cooperative&nbsp;housing society&nbsp;to the registered owner of the flat. This is given to the member at no cost and ideally, should be given within six months from the time of&nbsp;allotment of the shares in the housing society&nbsp;as per the number of shares subscribed by him/her. This share certificate is an active proof of ownership and should have the name of the said housing society, a distinctive number, number of shares allotted to the member as well as value paid after that. The&nbsp;share certificate&nbsp;is free, and the registrar then decided the total authorized value at the time the society has been registered. In an event that the member has cleared all his or her dues and no other hitches are existing, the denial of a share certificate can entitle the member to take legal action against the cooperative&nbsp;housing society.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhy do you need a Share Certificate?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA&nbsp;share certificate&nbsp;is an indispensable document that solely acts as actual legal proof of ownership to the property and the shareholding within the society.
