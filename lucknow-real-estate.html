This new infusion of growth capital is the first tranche of Awadh Properties’ ongoing goals of raising more than $100 million in capital in the near future. The company will be using this capital to continue expansion and investments in several verticals throughout the entire value chain.The Founder &amp; CEO at Awadh Properties, Tanuj Shori, stated that Square Yard has been mostly capital efficient from inception with a clear emphasis on ensuring higher ROI. The company has met important operational benchmarks over the last year including profitability and also the pilot success of its new ventures like home interiors, property management and rentals among others.

In India, developers and agents frequently use the words carpet area, built-up area, and super built-up area, prompting many people to search for explanations on the internet. In reality, some fraudulent companies have taken advantage of customers' lack of information by demanding greater costs. As a result, it is critical that you complete your study before speaking with your agent again.Awadh Properties explains the distinctions between the carpet area, built-up area, and super built-up area, three widely used terminologies:Carpet AreaA carpet area is an area that may be covered by a carpet, as the name suggests. The actual usable floor space of a house is determined by the distance between walls. Builders are required by RERA (Real Estate Regulation and Development Act) rules to reveal the carpet area of each unit upon which the selling price must be determined. This space does not include the area occupied by the exterior walls, balcony, or terrace, unlike the built-up area described below. The carpet area, which becomes your personal space, however, comprises the thickness of the house's interior walls.The carpet area covers roughly 70% of the built-up area, which includes the living area, bedrooms, and other rooms, the kitchen and baths, and, on some occasions, even the interior stairway. Assuming you have a built-up space of 1,000 square feet, the carpet area will be 70% of 1,000 square feet or 700 square feet.Calculate the carpet area using this formulaCarpet area = bedroom + living area + balconies + toilets – inner wall thicknessHow can you make sure you do not get misled when it comes to the carpet area?If you are purchasing a project in a large housing society, the developer is required by the RERA to disclose the carpet area of the unit. However, you need to hire a technical expert to come to the apartment and measure the space. If you apply for a mortgage, the bank will send a technical expert to inspect the property. Check with them to see whether the carpet area that the developer told you about is the same as what they estimated. If there are any inconsistencies, you should notify the developer and renegotiate the price.Another important point to keep in mind when buying a home is not to be carried away by the built-up or super-built-up area figures if the carpet area is not as per your preference. At the end of the day, the carpet area is the area that you will use in your everyday life. Ascertain that the three figures are perfectly balanced, with the carpet area taking the lead.A few other things to keep in mindWhile developers are now legally required to disclose the carpet area when measuring and pricing flats, provisions have been created for the measurement to be increased or decreased while a project is under construction. If the carpet area is lowered during construction, the developer is required to repay the extra cost to the customer within 45 days, plus yearly interest. If the carpet area is increased, the developer may require the buyer to pay the difference. The RERA, on the other hand, stipulates that the increase in carpet area cannot exceed 3%.Built-up AreaThe built-up area is the total size of the residential unit, which includes the carpet area as well as the thickness of the walls. This includes the area covered by the balcony or terrace. It usually accounts for roughly 70 to 80 percent of the estate's super built-up area. It should be remembered that the proportion may differ depending on the project or builder. The built-up area, on the other hand, is created by adding 10 to 15% more room to the carpet area. Assuming a super built-up area of 1,200 square feet, the built-up area will be 70% or 80% of 1,200 square feet, or 840 square feet or 960 square feet, respectively, while the carpet area will be 588 square feet or 672 square feet.Calculate the built-up area using this formulaBuilt-up area = carpet area + wall area + balcony areaCarpet Area vs Built-up Area: What is the difference?Carpet area refers to the space that may be covered by a carpet, whereas built-up area refers to the area that remains after the carpet.Super Built-up AreaThe super built-up area is the total of the built-up area plus the space used by common spaces such as the lobby, stairwell, lift, shafts, and clubhouse, among other things. Developers frequently charge consumers depending on this area to recoup their building costs. As a result, it is known as the "saleable" area. The loading factor, which is the proportionate share of the common space in a flat derived by multiplying the carpet area by a multiplier (1.25), is closely linked to the super built-up area. This equates to a 25% or 30% increase in total saleable area. The difference between the super built-up area and the carpet area is used to calculate its value. The loading factor is used by many builders to determine the pricing of a unit.Developers frequently utilized the super-built-up area as the space-measuring unit before the RERA made it necessary for them to sell apartments based on carpet area, to take advantage of the lack of clarity on space computation. They were able to reduce the properties per Sq. Ft cost by using a super built-up area as the measurement unit. It also gave the customer the idea that they were purchasing a huge home when they weren't.Since it becomes a benchmark for builders to charge their customers, the super built-up area is also known as the saleable area,” says Vijay Verma, CEO, Sunworld Group. The computation of a super built-up area is done differently when there is more than one unit on a level, he says.Assume a residence with a carpet area of 1,000 square feet that costs ₹2,000 per square foot. The total cost of the property, in this case, will be ₹20,00,000. A builder will give the super built-up area (let's say, 1,300 sq. ft) and price the home cheaper at, say, ₹1,800 per Sq. Ft to make the marketing pitch even more appealing. In this case, the property's total price will be ₹23.40 lakhs. The latter would sound far more appealing to an uninformed consumer than the former.Calculate the super built-up area using this formulaBuilt-up area + proportional common area = super built-up area.OrCarpet&nbsp;area (1+loading factor) = Super built-up areaRemember: Based on the developer and the specific location, the loading might be anywhere from 15 to 50 percent.Example of calculating the super built-up areaThe super built-up area is computed differently when there are many units on a floor.Suppose Rahul Patel owns a flat with a built-up area of 1,000 Sq. Ft on the fifth level of a housing society. Arun Prasad has a flat on the same level with a built-up area of 2,000 square feet. The floor's entire common area is 1,500 square feet.To calculate the super built-up area of the two flats the developer would split the built-up areas of the two flats by their ratio (in this example 1:2), then add 500 square feet to Patel's total built-up area and 1,000 square feet to Prasad's built-up area. Patel's flat now has a super built-up size of 1,500 Sq. Ft, whereas Prasad's has a super built-up area of 3,000 square feet.Can purchasers refuse to pay for a developer's increase in carpet area?Due to revisions in the plan and an increase in the carpet area, the developer has increased the overall price of the house on several occasions. The purchaser is responsible for the additional charges under RERA's terms. In a case brought by Ashley Neil Serrao and Mark Clement Serrao, who had acquired a property in Runwal Greens by Propel Developers Pvt Ltd, the Maharashtra RERA has openly stated that the purchaser is responsible for paying the extra money.How to determine the area of your future home's usable space?Always inquire about the carpet area of the apartment and base your price negotiations on this figure. You could seek the assistance of a private technical assessor to re-confirm the carpet area in the apartment so that there is no room for any deception. Those who purchase a home with the aid of housing financing are in a stronger position since the bank will send its own legal and technical assessors to inspect the property's specifications.Another thing to keep in mind is that even if a developer quotes the price of a home-based on carpet area, they will almost always increase per Sq. Ft cost to account for the built-up and super built-up areas. Try to find out how much similar projects in the region cost to see whether the amount your builder offered is reasonable. If not, the buyer has the option of negotiating the agreement and attempting to lower the pricing.Few More TermsNOC (No Objection Certificate)A no objection certificate is a legal document that states that an individual or corporation has been granted authorization to purchase or build real estate.Occupancy certificate (OC)The occupancy certificate is a crucial document that verifies that the building was built according to the approved designs and in accordance with local regulations. After verifying that all local laws have been followed, the local municipal corporation releases this document. The occupancy certificate must be obtained by the developer. When offering loans to property buyers, many financial firms require an occupancy certificate.Completion certificate (CC)A completion certification is a legal document that certifies that a new building has been erected and completed in accordance with the Buildings Act's safety standards and regulations, as well as municipal legislation.Haryana (RERA) has issued laws requiring flats to be sold only based on carpet areaOn April 27, 2021, the Haryana Real Estate Regulatory Authority (HARERA) announced that developers can only offer flats in their developments based on carpet area. The state RERA declared that the selling of apartments on a super area or any other bench would be considered deceptive and an unfair commercial activity, and that developers who violated these instructions would face penalties. “In real estate developments, the property is not correctly represented by stating the super area without precisely describing and breaking down the components contained in the super area. “The practice of selling real estate on a super area basis is deceptive, imprecise, opaque, and leads to misunderstanding and difficulties, as well as unnecessary litigation,” stated KK Khandelwal, chairman of Haryana RERA.You Might Also LikeSome of the key terms used in Real EstateRERA Carpet Area: Things You Must Know AboutCarpet area vs. built up area vs. super areaHow carpet area definition changes in RERABuilt up &amp; Super built up areaFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)","url": "https://www.squareyards.com/blog/get-familiar-with-these-real-estate-terms-carpet-area-built-up-area-and-super-built-up-area","thumbnailUrl": "https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Carpet-Area-Built-Up-Area-and-Super-Built-Up-Area.png","image": ["https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Carpet-Area-Built-Up-Area-and-Super-Built-Up-Area.png"],"datePublished": "July 17, 2021","dateModified": "July 17, 2021","author": {"@type": "Person","name": "Awadh Properties"},"publisher": {"@type": "Organization","name": "Samarjeet Chauhan","logo": {"@type": "ImageObject","url": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3627d95df82238dac2baa77774a028a7?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}},"description": "Understanding the technical jargon used by real estate brokers is critical for potential homebuyers to prevent mistakes that might jeopardize their chances of acquiring the house of their dreams.

Vastu Shastra is regarded as the science of designing and building houses, offices, temples, and other living spaces. Since ancient times, energy has been considered a free-flowing creation that can neither be created nor destroyed.&nbsp;The transformation from one form to the other is possible. This free-flowing energy directs all the positive or negative vibes and thoughts within ourselves and our surroundings. Following the sets of rules and regulations of Vastu before entering any new place is mandatory to live a healthy and peaceful life.Referring to our auspicious Mythology and Vedas, Vastu Shastra indicates the directions- East and North to be most blessed with positive energies; hence, North-facing homes are the most auspicious ones. Vastu Shastra for North Facing Homes is widely accepted because of the presence of Lord Kuber, also known as the God of Wealth, in the North direction. It is not only the north-facing home that brings in prosperity but the whole North-facing house planin which every direction should be planned as per the Vastu. North Facing Home Vastu includes a complete list of directions for different corners of the house that needs to be followed to attract good positive energies. The list is as follows:Master Bedroom: Should face South-west regionPooja Room: Should be located in North-east regionLiving Room: Should face North-east regionGuest Room: Should be in the North-west regionKitchen: Should lie in the South-east or North-west direction.About North Facing HomeBriefly describing since the existence of humans, directions have played an essential role in assisting where, what and when to hunt, hide and migrate. Era's changed, but directions still play a significant role in defining wealth and prosperity in human life; hence, the main entry gate of any house situated in the north direction is considered as North Facing Home that accounts for most positive energies.Are North Facing Homes Good or Bad?It would not be fitting to conclude that only North Facing House Plans are the most appropriate and good ones, and the rest of the directions are not; rather, all the directions have their specialty, no direction is good or bad. People need to follow specific guidelines of Vastu Shastra for North Facing Homes to attract prosperity to their homes.Location of Main Gate in North Facing House PlanIn any house plan, there is always a special emphasis on the location of the main gate because it is the entrance point of the home from where either all negative or all the positive forces will enter the home. Hence its placement is the major area of concern. So, in a North Facing House Plan, the main gate should only be located in the North direction, the distance between north-east and north-west is divided into nine equal parts, where also the fifth step is the most auspicious among all because of the belief of the existence of God of Wealth there.987654321↑ Towards NorthImportance of Padas in Vastu ShastraAccording to the Vastu Shastra, a north-facing home is the most auspicious location as no pada situated in this direction is considered inauspicious. But to attract prosperity and well-being of the family members, people should follow the following tips:As stated above, the fifth pada is considered the most auspicious among all the nine padas because of the presence of the Lord of wealth Kuber and determines the entrance of all the flow of energy in the house.

Vastu experts tell us how to take advantage of the power of west-facing homes to make them more profitable for homeowners. Home purchasers may make unusual decisions to bring prosperity and positive energy into their homes. Some people, for instance, may only desire an east-facing residence, north-facing bedrooms, or perhaps an east-facing kid's room.In truth, west-facing residences are less desirable due to a prevalent misunderstanding that they are unfortunate and inauspicious. According to experts of Vastu Shastra for west-facing homes, all angles are equal yet come with specific restrictions that one should be aware of for positivity to flow freely in the home.Even if a lovely west-facing house is available, numerous real estate brokers or lucrative property advertising will try to persuade you to buy other properties. They frequently advertise such homes at a significantly higher price, claiming that they are in high demand. It is fairly unusual for people to believe and propagate rumours that a west-facing home brings bad luck and should be avoided. On the flip side, the reality is quite different than it actually is. Nevertheless, Awadh Properties is here to burst these misconceptions.According to Indian Vastu gurus, each direction has its meaning and is equally fortunate. So, ensure that the property is Vastu compliant. It will help you and your family have a happy and wealthy life ahead. Today, we will dig deep into the significance of the Vastu designs for west-facing homes. So, stay connected with us as we investigate why you should not dismiss a magnificent west-facing house just based on misconceptions and rumours. So, let's get started.What is a West-facing house?A residence or apartment is termed west-facing if the main entrance faces west. Normally, west-facing residences are not considered auspicious, but Vastu experts disagree. West-facing residences' main entrances should be somewhat to the north-west or in the center. When it comes to the main door, the southwest approach should be avoided at all costs.The 5th and 6th pada will be the finest for the main door if you split the lengths from the northwest angle to the west corner into nine equal sections or pada, with the first in one in the west and the ninth one in the southwest. The seventh, eighth, as well as ninth padas should not be used for the entry since they are regarded as the devil's energy corner.Nevertheless, as per Vastu Shastra, all dwellings are regarded equally auspicious. Therefore west-facing homes are no less fortunate than north or east-facing ones. If certain Vastu Shastra principles are followed, a west-facing home can be as wealthy as other dwellings. In this blog, we will look at the benefits of choosing a west-facing apartment as well as the Vastu principles to follow while building a west-facing home.According to the real convictions of the intellectual movement of Vastu Shastra, all dwellings, whether they are north, east, west, as well as south-facing, are regarded equally fortunate if they are built according to Vastu Shastra design concepts. According to Vastu Shastra, the orientation of the dwelling has no bearing. It all depends on where the house's primary entrance or door is located.Is there any benefit?Homes with west-facing doors, however, according to Japanese house design principles, exude youth and enthusiasm. West-facing doors are said to let more energy into the dwelling. As a result, all traditional Geisha residences in Japan have their main entrance facing west. Folks who reside in west-facing residences are seen to be affluent and have a large social circle. They will have no adversaries and will be adored by everyone at work, relationships, and social contexts. Lawmakers, teachers, religious figures, and entrepreneurs benefit from living in residences with a west-facing orientation.The kids' room in a west-facing house might be located on the south or western side, while the guest room can be located on the northwest. However, according to Vastu, the pooja room and sitting room should be at the northeast quadrant of the home, as it is the most fortunate corner.The main bedroom should be oriented to the southwest. Your master bedroom must be on the upper floor of a multi-level home. Choose the east side for your kitchen. According to Vastu, the kitchen must not be placed immediately under or above the pooja room, bedrooms, or toilet.The main benefit of a west-facing home is that you can enjoy the brightness and brilliance of the setting sun until dusk. Some people believe that a home facing the west will bring them more prosperity and fortune. They will have no adversaries and will be popular at work and also in social situations. Politicians, business entrepreneurs, teachers, and spiritual figures are said to prefer residences with a west-facing orientation. It is also said to be beneficial to children since it provides them with energy and happiness.You may have noticed that having a house that faces west or north is unattractive or brings bad omen, and so on. But much like any other property, you may employ Vastu principles to make a west-facing house fortunate. The west is not considered an unfavourable direction in Vastu Shastra. In fact, according to Vastu Shastra, any orientation is excellent for a home. However, the position of the entry or main door is the determining element in Vastu for your property.There is a popular misconception that west-facing dwellings are Vastu-defying, but this isn't true. West-facing houses rank below north-and east-facing buildings in terms of auspiciousness, but they are not unlucky. In fact, Vastu principles claim that the West-facing homes offer profits and financial and non-financial advantages.Vastu Tips for your West-facing HouseAs per Vastu Shastra, it is critical for homeowners developing or purchasing new homes to establish a clear door situated within the appropriate 'padas' or steps. The number of padas is calculated by dividing the house into nine equal sections, starting at the northwest corner, and working southward. In west-facing residences, the fourth, third, fifth, and sixth padas are the most auspicious for main entrances because they bring optimism and pleasant feelings. If the earlier in this thread padas are unavailable, the main door might be placed on padas one and two, which are neither excellent nor bad.The kitchen is the main house engine and a source of good health and happiness for everyone who lives there. Therefore, Vastu adherents must construct their kitchens in the proper orientation. The kitchen should be in the eastern part or southeast part of the home, according to Vastu shastra. It is claimed that doing so guarantees that a kitchen's positive charm is at its peak.According to Vastu principles, the master bedroom should be in the house's southern part. As a result, if the property has more than one story, the master bedroom should preferably be on the top floor. For bedrooms, there is a greater variety of direction options. As a result, they can be placed on the building's south, west, or western most sides. It is preferable to have your master bedroom on the southwest side of the house. This orientation helps in increasing communication between couples in the room. If you have a multi-story home, the master bedroom should be on the top floor. This would bring prosperity, peace, and ancestral benefits to your household.According to Vastu principles, private pools, storage tanks, and water submersible pumps should not be erected towards the west. Open areas should be located on the Eastern side of the building, away from the Western direction.Colors like white, silvery, yellowish, and beige are most suited for west-facing houses, as per Vastu principles. Furthermore, it is claimed that these colours increase earnings and benefits from the Western direction. On the other hand, the home is oriented more towards the West than other directions, a lighter shade of blue can be employed to take advantage of the direction's advantages. Off-white as well as creams are Vastu-neutral colors, making them safe choices when faced with a color palette.Make sure your primary door entry is in the Midwest or Northwest corner of your house. Metalwork, such as a metallic name board or a metallic bell should be designed for your west-facing entrance. Maintain a detritus main entry area. Remove any trash cans or damaged furniture from the area around the entrance door.The first and best step is to establish whether you have a property that faces west. Determining the same might be difficult because many people believe that the setting sun is in the west. The precise west direction, on the other hand, fluctuates year to year. You can establish the precise west side in only two days every year.The temple, also known as a pooja room, is a sacred space where you may harness all of the divine forces surrounding you. The northeast direction is the most energetic zone in a west-facing home; therefore, it makes complete sense to put it in this corner. However, not every home has the necessary space to have a separate pooja room. If your lounge room does not have enough space for this, you can position your living room inside the north and a tiny temple or pooja stand inside the north part.While verifying the directional face of the property, use a magnetic compass to trace the precise west.Make sure the current house's main entrance is only in the third or fourth padas.Build the walls mainly on the south and west sides of the building- a bit thicker and taller than those on the east and north sides.Place your living room as well as the Pooja room at the northeast corner of the house, as this is the most auspicious part of the house.If you don't have a pooja room, install the temple inside the living room's north part.Make sure the kid's room is facing either west, south, or north-west.If your plot is slanted, ensure that it is slanted from south to north.Things you must avoidAvoid using the setting sun to discover the precise west direction.Except for the ones listed, avoid all other padas unless you visit a Vastu specialist beforehand.Avoid buying land with a north-to-south slope since it may result in financial losses.Avoid buying a parcel of land or a house with a southwest or south direction expansion.A bore well, a storage tank or a sump should not be located in the southwest corner of a west-facing residence.A kitchen should not be placed in the house's southwest corner.Sleeping beneath a beam or a wall divider is not a good idea.Make sure your legs aren't pointed towards the bedroom door as you sleep.Purchase a property with a South and West border that is thinner than the East and North boundaries.Avoid any home with the main entrance blocked by a huge item such as a tree or an electric pole.ConclusionAs can be seen, the Vastu of west facing property is just as excellent as any other Vastu.

Vastu experts tell us how to take advantage of the power of west-facing homes to make them more profitable for homeowners. Home purchasers may make unusual decisions to bring prosperity and positive energy into their homes. Some people, for instance, may only desire an east-facing residence, north-facing bedrooms, or perhaps an east-facing kid's room.In truth, west-facing residences are less desirable due to a prevalent misunderstanding that they are unfortunate and inauspicious. According to experts of Vastu Shastra for west-facing homes, all angles are equal yet come with specific restrictions that one should be aware of for positivity to flow freely in the home.Even if a lovely west-facing house is available, numerous real estate brokers or lucrative property advertising will try to persuade you to buy other properties. They frequently advertise such homes at a significantly higher price, claiming that they are in high demand. It is fairly unusual for people to believe and propagate rumours that a west-facing home brings bad luck and should be avoided. On the flip side, the reality is quite different than it actually is. Nevertheless, Awadh Properties is here to burst these misconceptions.According to Indian Vastu gurus, each direction has its meaning and is equally fortunate. So, ensure that the property is Vastu compliant. It will help you and your family have a happy and wealthy life ahead. Today, we will dig deep into the significance of the Vastu designs for west-facing homes. So, stay connected with us as we investigate why you should not dismiss a magnificent west-facing house just based on misconceptions and rumours. So, let's get started.What is a West-facing house?A residence or apartment is termed west-facing if the main entrance faces west. Normally, west-facing residences are not considered auspicious, but Vastu experts disagree. West-facing residences' main entrances should be somewhat to the north-west or in the center. When it comes to the main door, the southwest approach should be avoided at all costs.The 5th and 6th pada will be the finest for the main door if you split the lengths from the northwest angle to the west corner into nine equal sections or pada, with the first in one in the west and the ninth one in the southwest. The seventh, eighth, as well as ninth padas should not be used for the entry since they are regarded as the devil's energy corner.Nevertheless, as per Vastu Shastra, all dwellings are regarded equally auspicious. Therefore west-facing homes are no less fortunate than north or east-facing ones. If certain Vastu Shastra principles are followed, a west-facing home can be as wealthy as other dwellings. In this blog, we will look at the benefits of choosing a west-facing apartment as well as the Vastu principles to follow while building a west-facing home.According to the real convictions of the intellectual movement of Vastu Shastra, all dwellings, whether they are north, east, west, as well as south-facing, are regarded equally fortunate if they are built according to Vastu Shastra design concepts. According to Vastu Shastra, the orientation of the dwelling has no bearing. It all depends on where the house's primary entrance or door is located.Is there any benefit?Homes with west-facing doors, however, according to Japanese house design principles, exude youth and enthusiasm. West-facing doors are said to let more energy into the dwelling. As a result, all traditional Geisha residences in Japan have their main entrance facing west. Folks who reside in west-facing residences are seen to be affluent and have a large social circle. They will have no adversaries and will be adored by everyone at work, relationships, and social contexts. Lawmakers, teachers, religious figures, and entrepreneurs benefit from living in residences with a west-facing orientation.The kids' room in a west-facing house might be located on the south or western side, while the guest room can be located on the northwest. However, according to Vastu, the pooja room and sitting room should be at the northeast quadrant of the home, as it is the most fortunate corner.The main bedroom should be oriented to the southwest. Your master bedroom must be on the upper floor of a multi-level home. Choose the east side for your kitchen. According to Vastu, the kitchen must not be placed immediately under or above the pooja room, bedrooms, or toilet.The main benefit of a west-facing home is that you can enjoy the brightness and brilliance of the setting sun until dusk. Some people believe that a home facing the west will bring them more prosperity and fortune. They will have no adversaries and will be popular at work and also in social situations. Politicians, business entrepreneurs, teachers, and spiritual figures are said to prefer residences with a west-facing orientation. It is also said to be beneficial to children since it provides them with energy and happiness.You may have noticed that having a house that faces west or north is unattractive or brings bad omen, and so on. But much like any other property, you may employ Vastu principles to make a west-facing house fortunate. The west is not considered an unfavourable direction in Vastu Shastra. In fact, according to Vastu Shastra, any orientation is excellent for a home. However, the position of the entry or main door is the determining element in Vastu for your property.There is a popular misconception that west-facing dwellings are Vastu-defying, but this isn't true. West-facing houses rank below north-and east-facing buildings in terms of auspiciousness, but they are not unlucky. In fact, Vastu principles claim that the West-facing homes offer profits and financial and non-financial advantages.Vastu Tips for your West-facing HouseAs per Vastu Shastra, it is critical for homeowners developing or purchasing new homes to establish a clear door situated within the appropriate 'padas' or steps. The number of padas is calculated by dividing the house into nine equal sections, starting at the northwest corner, and working southward. In west-facing residences, the fourth, third, fifth, and sixth padas are the most auspicious for main entrances because they bring optimism and pleasant feelings. If the earlier in this thread padas are unavailable, the main door might be placed on padas one and two, which are neither excellent nor bad.The kitchen is the main house engine and a source of good health and happiness for everyone who lives there. Therefore, Vastu adherents must construct their kitchens in the proper orientation. The kitchen should be in the eastern part or southeast part of the home, according to Vastu shastra. It is claimed that doing so guarantees that a kitchen's positive charm is at its peak.According to Vastu principles, the master bedroom should be in the house's southern part. As a result, if the property has more than one story, the master bedroom should preferably be on the top floor. For bedrooms, there is a greater variety of direction options. As a result, they can be placed on the building's south, west, or western most sides. It is preferable to have your master bedroom on the southwest side of the house. This orientation helps in increasing communication between couples in the room. If you have a multi-story home, the master bedroom should be on the top floor. This would bring prosperity, peace, and ancestral benefits to your household.According to Vastu principles, private pools, storage tanks, and water submersible pumps should not be erected towards the west. Open areas should be located on the Eastern side of the building, away from the Western direction.Colors like white, silvery, yellowish, and beige are most suited for west-facing houses, as per Vastu principles. Furthermore, it is claimed that these colours increase earnings and benefits from the Western direction. On the other hand, the home is oriented more towards the West than other directions, a lighter shade of blue can be employed to take advantage of the direction's advantages. Off-white as well as creams are Vastu-neutral colors, making them safe choices when faced with a color palette.Make sure your primary door entry is in the Midwest or Northwest corner of your house. Metalwork, such as a metallic name board or a metallic bell should be designed for your west-facing entrance. Maintain a detritus main entry area. Remove any trash cans or damaged furniture from the area around the entrance door.The first and best step is to establish whether you have a property that faces west. Determining the same might be difficult because many people believe that the setting sun is in the west. The precise west direction, on the other hand, fluctuates year to year. You can establish the precise west side in only two days every year.The temple, also known as a pooja room, is a sacred space where you may harness all of the divine forces surrounding you. The northeast direction is the most energetic zone in a west-facing home; therefore, it makes complete sense to put it in this corner. However, not every home has the necessary space to have a separate pooja room. If your lounge room does not have enough space for this, you can position your living room inside the north and a tiny temple or pooja stand inside the north part.While verifying the directional face of the property, use a magnetic compass to trace the precise west.Make sure the current house's main entrance is only in the third or fourth padas.Build the walls mainly on the south and west sides of the building- a bit thicker and taller than those on the east and north sides.Place your living room as well as the Pooja room at the northeast corner of the house, as this is the most auspicious part of the house.If you don't have a pooja room, install the temple inside the living room's north part.Make sure the kid's room is facing either west, south, or north-west.If your plot is slanted, ensure that it is slanted from south to north.Things you must avoidAvoid using the setting sun to discover the precise west direction.Except for the ones listed, avoid all other padas unless you visit a Vastu specialist beforehand.Avoid buying land with a north-to-south slope since it may result in financial losses.Avoid buying a parcel of land or a house with a southwest or south direction expansion.A bore well, a storage tank or a sump should not be located in the southwest corner of a west-facing residence.A kitchen should not be placed in the house's southwest corner.Sleeping beneath a beam or a wall divider is not a good idea.Make sure your legs aren't pointed towards the bedroom door as you sleep.Purchase a property with a South and West border that is thinner than the East and North boundaries.Avoid any home with the main entrance blocked by a huge item such as a tree or an electric pole.ConclusionAs can be seen, the Vastu of west facing property is just as excellent as any other Vastu. All you have to do now is make sure you follow all of the Vastu regulations. If you are building a house on a plot, it is rather simple. However, if you are moving to a flat or apartment, you may face several difficulties. It is frequently impossible to carry out a remodel that necessitates structural changes.You Might Also LikeHow to Improve Vastu for a South-facing Home?Vastu for Flats &amp; Apartments: 15 Major signs to watch out forNorth Facing House Vastu Plan for a Peaceful LifeWest Facing House Vastu Plan &amp; TipsWest Facing House Vastu PlanFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)"}</script>

The managing committees of a housing society have the key responsibility of ensuring that all the proof of sale towards the property is rightfully issued. A&nbsp;share certificate, quite like the sale deed is proper proof that the rightful owner of the said property must possess.&nbsp;Sometimes,&nbsp;housing society members&nbsp;tend to overlook or forget to issue these share certificates to the members which can be a problem in case a property-related issue occurs. While the sale deed does act as proof that you are the official owner of the property, a share certificate is legal proof of the same and is indispensable. The managing committee must ensure you have this but in case you do not have one, you can obtain one with ease.&nbsp;What is a Share Certificate?&nbsp;In simple terms, a&nbsp;share certificate&nbsp;is a legal document or certification provided by a cooperative&nbsp;housing society&nbsp;to the registered owner of the flat. This is given to the member at no cost and ideally, should be given within six months from the time of&nbsp;allotment of the shares in the housing society&nbsp;as per the number of shares subscribed by him/her. This share certificate is an active proof of ownership and should have the name of the said housing society, a distinctive number, number of shares allotted to the member as well as value paid after that. The&nbsp;share certificate&nbsp;is free, and the registrar then decided the total authorized value at the time the society has been registered. In an event that the member has cleared all his or her dues and no other hitches are existing, the denial of a share certificate can entitle the member to take legal action against the cooperative&nbsp;housing society.&nbsp;Why do you need a Share Certificate?&nbsp;A&nbsp;share certificate&nbsp;is an indispensable document that solely acts as actual legal proof of ownership to the property and the shareholding within the society. The sale deed is also an important document, but the share certificate trumps that in case of official demand. This answer the question of&nbsp;what is a share certificate and why do you need it.&nbsp;A Checklist for the Issuance of a Share Certificate&nbsp;What to check before/after getting a share certificate&nbsp;is stated below and should be well kept in mind.&nbsp;The&nbsp;share certificate&nbsp;must be collected by the member in person himself/herself.&nbsp;There should be no dues or penalties on the member's property. In case there are any, they should be immediately paid up.&nbsp;An important document called the 'conveyance deed' that is issued by the builder should be in the possession of the&nbsp;housing society.&nbsp;The&nbsp;share certificate&nbsp;should be signed by the secretary, chairman, and any other member of the managing committee along with the official seal of the&nbsp;housing society.&nbsp;The share certificate should be authorized by the managing committee first and only then issued by the secretary.&nbsp;The housing society will demand that you give an&nbsp;indemnity bond&nbsp;which means that under no circumstances should the allotted shares be transferred to any individual or entity for any purpose whatsoever.&nbsp;The names on the&nbsp;share certificate&nbsp;should be exactly in the same order as it appears on the original sale agreement between the builder and the member. This includes primary as well as associate members.&nbsp;The member will need to indemnify the cooperative housing society against any loans and complete any incomplete paperwork before the&nbsp;share certificate&nbsp;can be issued.&nbsp;No typos or spelling errors should be there in the name and other content on the sale deed. With this you can stay away from any issues that can arrive in future.While collecting the&nbsp;share certificate, the member will need to present the original sale deed.&nbsp;Ensure that after you collect the&nbsp;share certificate, all the required signatures as per the society members, official seal, etc. are present on it.&nbsp;Transferring of Share Certificate in Case of ResaleCertain norms need to be followed in case of a resale. In such a scenario, the original&nbsp;share certificate&nbsp;will have to be given to the housing society along with any other documents as needed. In case the share certificate is being transferred in the name of the new member of the housing society after the resale, all procedures about the transfer of the share certificate will need to be made prior to any finalization. The following mentioned points should be kept in mind under such a circumstance.The new member will need to pay the premium for the transfer of the share certificate.&nbsp;The new member will have to make sure that all dues should be cleared by the previous owner of the property.&nbsp;The new member will need to produce all the documents and necessary applications required by the&nbsp;housing society. These documents and applications should be in mint condition.&nbsp;In an event that the original member dies, his or her consequent heirs will have to make an application for the share transfer to the appointed nominee and a new share certificate will have to be obtained.&nbsp;The new share certificate should be issued by the cooperative&nbsp;housing society&nbsp;within the stipulated time, a lack of which can allow the member to take necessary legal action.Readymade&nbsp;share certificate&nbsp;booklets are readily available online. Moreover, you can get them at book printing agencies as well as housing federation offices.&nbsp;Issuance of a Duplicate Share Certificate&nbsp;Just as in the case of any important document, it is advisable to keep the original copy of the&nbsp;share certificate&nbsp;in a safe place and a proper condition. If you damage or lose this, getting a duplicate is not a simple task. However, it is difficult but not impossible. You can request the&nbsp;housing society members&nbsp;to issue you a new one and for this, you will need to follow the steps mentioned below.Step 1&nbsp;– The very first thing you will need to do is visit the local police station within your jurisdiction and file an FIR. You will need to add all the details in a registering report that will include details of whether the certificate is lost, damaged, misplaced, stolen, etc. Once this is done, you will need to retain the FIR acknowledgment by the police as you will need it for future communication and reference.Step 2&nbsp;– Once the FIR is complete, you will then need to inform the housing society members of this mishap. For this, you will be required to send a written application to them in which you will request them to issue you a new duplicate share certificate. This application will also need to have the details of what happened to the original copy. (i.e whether it is stolen, lost, misplaced, damaged, untraceable, etc.) You will also need to attach the FIR acknowledgment copy that you will have received after filing the FIR. (First Information Report).&nbsp;Step 3&nbsp;– After step 2, you will need to submit an&nbsp;indemnity bond&nbsp;of Rs. 200 to the cooperative housing society. This will clear the society of all costs resulting due to the issuance of the new duplicate&nbsp;share certificate. All costs that arise for this procedure will have to be borne by the member himself/herself. Make sure that this indemnity bond is officially notarized and attach the FIR acknowledgment copy along with it.&nbsp;Step 4 –&nbsp;Once the above-mentioned steps are complete, the managing committee will then review your application along with all the attached paperwork in the next general body meeting in which they will decide whether they want to approve or disapprove your request.&nbsp;Step 5 –&nbsp;If your request is approved, the housing society will then display a notice on the main notice board of the society so that all other members can have a look. Additionally, the society will also publish notices in at least two newspapers. All of this will be in regards to the issuing of a duplicate share certificate, the cost of which will need to be paid by the applicant.&nbsp;Step 6 –&nbsp;You along with the society will have to wait for a minimum of 15 days to see if any objections are made.&nbsp;Step 7 –&nbsp;If everything goes smoothly, and no objections are made, the housing society will then issue a new duplicate share certificate to you which you will have to collect in person when ready.&nbsp;So if you have lost or misplaced your original copy and are asking yourself, 'Can I get a duplicate one?" the above-mentioned procedure will help you with the same.  The ownership of a share certificate is extremely important for a property owner in a cooperative housing society. It does not only act as a legal document for your rights but also proves the allotment of shares of that society in your name. Without this share certificate, you can face issues in the future such as transferring the property to the rightful heirs, involvement or rights in any social events, police aid in case of crime, and many other such issues that may occur.

The managing committees of a housing society have the key responsibility of ensuring that all the proof of sale towards the property is rightfully issued. A&nbsp;share certificate, quite like the sale deed is proper proof that the rightful owner of the said property must possess.&nbsp;Sometimes,&nbsp;housing society members&nbsp;tend to overlook or forget to issue these share certificates to the members which can be a problem in case a property-related issue occurs. While the sale deed does act as proof that you are the official owner of the property, a share certificate is legal proof of the same and is indispensable. The managing committee must ensure you have this but in case you do not have one, you can obtain one with ease.&nbsp;What is a Share Certificate?&nbsp;In simple terms, a&nbsp;share certificate&nbsp;is a legal document or certification provided by a cooperative&nbsp;housing society&nbsp;to the registered owner of the flat. This is given to the member at no cost and ideally, should be given within six months from the time of&nbsp;allotment of the shares in the housing society&nbsp;as per the number of shares subscribed by him/her. This share certificate is an active proof of ownership and should have the name of the said housing society, a distinctive number, number of shares allotted to the member as well as value paid after that. The&nbsp;share certificate&nbsp;is free, and the registrar then decided the total authorized value at the time the society has been registered. In an event that the member has cleared all his or her dues and no other hitches are existing, the denial of a share certificate can entitle the member to take legal action against the cooperative&nbsp;housing society.&nbsp;Why do you need a Share Certificate?&nbsp;A&nbsp;share certificate&nbsp;is an indispensable document that solely acts as actual legal proof of ownership to the property and the shareholding within the society. The sale deed is also an important document, but the share certificate trumps that in case of official demand. This answer the question of&nbsp;what is a share certificate and why do you need it.&nbsp;A Checklist for the Issuance of a Share Certificate&nbsp;What to check before/after getting a share certificate&nbsp;is stated below and should be well kept in mind.&nbsp;The&nbsp;share certificate&nbsp;must be collected by the member in person himself/herself.&nbsp;There should be no dues or penalties on the member's property. In case there are any, they should be immediately paid up.&nbsp;An important document called the 'conveyance deed' that is issued by the builder should be in the possession of the&nbsp;housing society.&nbsp;The&nbsp;share certificate&nbsp;should be signed by the secretary, chairman, and any other member of the managing committee along with the official seal of the&nbsp;housing society.&nbsp;The share certificate should be authorized by the managing committee first and only then issued by the secretary.&nbsp;The housing society will demand that you give an&nbsp;indemnity bond&nbsp;which means that under no circumstances should the allotted shares be transferred to any individual or entity for any purpose whatsoever.&nbsp;The names on the&nbsp;share certificate&nbsp;should be exactly in the same order as it appears on the original sale agreement between the builder and the member. This includes primary as well as associate members.&nbsp;The member will need to indemnify the cooperative housing society against any loans and complete any incomplete paperwork before the&nbsp;share certificate&nbsp;can be issued.&nbsp;No typos or spelling errors should be there in the name and other content on the sale deed. With this you can stay away from any issues that can arrive in future.While collecting the&nbsp;share certificate, the member will need to present the original sale deed.&nbsp;Ensure that after you collect the&nbsp;share certificate, all the required signatures as per the society members, official seal, etc. are present on it.&nbsp;Transferring of Share Certificate in Case of ResaleCertain norms need to be followed in case of a resale. In such a scenario, the original&nbsp;share certificate&nbsp;will have to be given to the housing society along with any other documents as needed. In case the share certificate is being transferred in the name of the new member of the housing society after the resale, all procedures about the transfer of the share certificate will need to be made prior to any finalization. The following mentioned points should be kept in mind under such a circumstance.The new member will need to pay the premium for the transfer of the share certificate.&nbsp;The new member will have to make sure that all dues should be cleared by the previous owner of the property.&nbsp;The new member will need to produce all the documents and necessary applications required by the&nbsp;housing society. These documents and applications should be in mint condition.&nbsp;In an event that the original member dies, his or her consequent heirs will have to make an application for the share transfer to the appointed nominee and a new share certificate will have to be obtained.&nbsp;The new share certificate should be issued by the cooperative&nbsp;housing society&nbsp;within the stipulated time, a lack of which can allow the member to take necessary legal action.Readymade&nbsp;share certificate&nbsp;booklets are readily available online. Moreover, you can get them at book printing agencies as well as housing federation offices.&nbsp;Issuance of a Duplicate Share Certificate&nbsp;Just as in the case of any important document, it is advisable to keep the original copy of the&nbsp;share certificate&nbsp;in a safe place and a proper condition. If you damage or lose this, getting a duplicate is not a simple task. However, it is difficult but not impossible. You can request the&nbsp;housing society members&nbsp;to issue you a new one and for this, you will need to follow the steps mentioned below.Step 1&nbsp;– The very first thing you will need to do is visit the local police station within your jurisdiction and file an FIR. You will need to add all the details in a registering report that will include details of whether the certificate is lost, damaged, misplaced, stolen, etc. Once this is done, you will need to retain the FIR acknowledgment by the police as you will need it for future communication and reference.Step 2&nbsp;– Once the FIR is complete, you will then need to inform the housing society members of this mishap. For this, you will be required to send a written application to them in which you will request them to issue you a new duplicate share certificate. This application will also need to have the details of what happened to the original copy. (i.e whether it is stolen, lost, misplaced, damaged, untraceable, etc.) You will also need to attach the FIR acknowledgment copy that you will have received after filing the FIR. (First Information Report).&nbsp;Step 3&nbsp;– After step 2, you will need to submit an&nbsp;indemnity bond&nbsp;of Rs. 200 to the cooperative housing society. This will clear the society of all costs resulting due to the issuance of the new duplicate&nbsp;share certificate. All costs that arise for this procedure will have to be borne by the member himself/herself. Make sure that this indemnity bond is officially notarized and attach the FIR acknowledgment copy along with it.&nbsp;Step 4 –&nbsp;Once the above-mentioned steps are complete, the managing committee will then review your application along with all the attached paperwork in the next general body meeting in which they will decide whether they want to approve or disapprove your request.&nbsp;Step 5 –&nbsp;If your request is approved, the housing society will then display a notice on the main notice board of the society so that all other members can have a look. Additionally, the society will also publish notices in at least two newspapers. All of this will be in regards to the issuing of a duplicate share certificate, the cost of which will need to be paid by the applicant.&nbsp;Step 6 –&nbsp;You along with the society will have to wait for a minimum of 15 days to see if any objections are made.&nbsp;Step 7 –&nbsp;If everything goes smoothly, and no objections are made, the housing society will then issue a new duplicate share certificate to you which you will have to collect in person when ready.&nbsp;So if you have lost or misplaced your original copy and are asking yourself, 'Can I get a duplicate one?" the above-mentioned procedure will help you with the same.  The ownership of a share certificate is extremely important for a property owner in a cooperative housing society. It does not only act as a legal document for your rights but also proves the allotment of shares of that society in your name. Without this share certificate, you can face issues in the future such as transferring the property to the rightful heirs, involvement or rights in any social events, police aid in case of crime, and many other such issues that may occur. Fortunately, even if the housing society has forgotten to issue this share certificate to you, you can now get it at any time from them.

Such structures have been part of the Indian subcontinent for centuries now. &nbsp;It is not just the valuation of the historical structures that are assets for the nation. Their mere existence is a value addition. One of such structures, the Daulatabad Fort, is the highlight of this particular article.This site acts as one of the famous sites to pay a visit to. Located in the state of Maharashtra, the historic site is also commonly addressed in the names of ‘Deogiri fort’ or ‘Devagiri fort’. It lies right in close premises of Aurangabad, in the village of Daulatabad. Owing to its majestic size, it has been an important capital to some famous dynasties that once ruled India. Through this article, we would bring about its significance in the Indian subcontinent.Daulatabad fort Aurangabad historyHistorians claim that the fort has been in use since 100 BCE. Initially, the remains of temples mainly belonging to the Hindu and Jain structures were found there. Such structures resemble those seen in the forts of Ajanta and Ellora caves of India.&nbsp; The carvings found in it are mostly that of Jain Tirthankara.Bhillama V, who was a Yadava prince in 1187, is considered the founder who discovered the fort while establishing their superiority in the western region. The primary aim of the Yadava dynasty was to outdo the Chalukyas rulers. The rulers of the Yadava dynasty have faced several invasions during their rule in the western region.Right when the kingdom was under the rule of king Ramachandra, Allaudin Khilji, the great ruler from the Khilji dynasty, made attempts to raid the fort. In 1296, the Khiljis placed their first attempt at a raid. Owing to the crisis, the Yadava dynasty started paying tributes to the actions of the king of the Delhi Sultanate.Establishment of the Daulatabad FortIn the year 1308, a second attempt of the raid was made by the Khilji to the king Ramachandran. This time, it was even more fierce. Allaudin proposed to bring down the Yadava rulers and thus making king Ramachandran subordinate to himself. Later, in 1328, Muhammad Bin Tughlaq wanted to shift his capital from Delhi to Devagiri.Owing allegiance to the king’s preference, the place was renamed Daulatabad. The intention behind making it the capital seemed logical to many. Taking into consideration the regime of Muhammad Bin Tughlaq, the Daulatabad fort was placed right in the centre. Such a location preference would act as a guard from attracting the kingdom capital from the north-western frontier regions.Bin Tughlaq’s decision was to shift his region from Delhi to Daulatabad. Thus, he orders his common population to shift their location. Later, eventually, he feels the decision to be inapt in the year 1334. Following his realization, he retreated his steps back and shifted the Delhi sultanate capital to Delhi all over again.Value-addition by the Ahmednagar sultanateIn the year 1499, the Daulatabad fort was under the purview of the Ahmednagar sultanate, who treated it as their secondary capital. Later, in 1610, the city of Aurangabad was regarded as the Ahmednagar sultanate capital. The sultanate was presided over by Malik Ambar, who was an Ethiopian military general. He was also regarded as the prime minister of the Ahmednagar sultanate.During the reign of the Ahmednagar sultanate, the region witnessed several value addition factors. One such example would be the construction of Chand Minar, which was an inspiration from the Qutub Minar of Delhi. The fortification is not a mere structure. It was crafted by people brought from Iran, especially for the purpose.Another important aspect noticeable there is the Chini Mahal. It was specifically built by Aurangzeb to imprison Abul Hasan Tana Shah. Abul Hasan Tana Shah was the last ruler of the Qutb Shahi Dynasty, who Aurangzeb imprisoned in 1687. That's how, after taking over the Daulatabad fort by the Ahmednagar sultanate, a lot more was added to the value of the place.Unique features of the Daulatabad fortSeveral aspects of the fort are such that make it unique and ingenious. The structure is well known for its architecture built with a aim to make the fort defensive against the enemies. The whole shape of the fort is triangular. Besides, there are some interesting facts that make it one of the priceless possessions of the Indian subcontinent.It was none other than Mohammad bin Tughlaq who renamed it as Daulatabad fort. Prior to that, it was mostly a fort recognized in Devagiri.&nbsp;During the reign of Mohammad bin Tughlaq, he ordered his population to relocate from Delhi to Daulatabad. Though he later realized it to be not a fair enough idea.Several key fortifications are added to the fort, which makes it even more valuable and serves as a great sight to pay a visit to.The walls of the structure are massive in length and thickness. The thickness of each wall is about six to nine feet, whereas the length extends to about 18-27 feet.The area known as mahakot inside the premises of the fort is a significant highlight.Other walls of the fort, too, are specially equipped to hold within themselves certain arms and ammunition.There is a Hathi haud built in the fort premises with a capacity to hold about 10,000 cubic meters of water.The Chand Minar built additionally to the fort is 30 meters tall with three balconies-like structures that are circular in shape.The Yadava dynasty and its rulers had made improvisations on the hill in which the fort lies. The purpose behind undertaking such actions was to build up a defence mechanism.There is a narrow bridge that leads to the fort, and that is the only gateway.There are several extra false additions to the fort that would act as traps for enemies.Unique architectures of the fort &nbsp;&nbsp;It was built on a hill with a conical shape heightened at about 200 meters. One is most likely to find bastions and lofty gates throughout its premises. The structure of the fort is built over an area of 94.83 hectares with impeccable town planning and water management facilities. Four walls have enclosed few areas of the fort with a high mechanism to defend against the enemies.&nbsp;To protect people in times of war or other emergencies, different structures have been built all across the fort in different locations. For example, amarkot is meant to capacitate the ordinary population of the kingdom. Mahakot, on the other hand, is meant to hold residences of the higher classes. The kalakot, on the other hand, is meant to secure residences of the royal class. The balakot is the ultimate peak where you can find the flag and pride of honour.The fort is equipped with structures such as stepped wells, water Reservoirs, Minar, Hammam, Baradari, Andheri, Temples, Mosques, etc. Besides, there are several uneven structures of rock-cut caves that lie unfinished. Other than that, there is the Aam Khas building, Royal Hammam, Rang Mahal, Chini Mahal, and several other essential elements that a medieval fort is typically meant to accommodate within itself.Key fortifications of the Daulatabad FortThere are some of the key fortifications that are an essential part of the fort even today. Here are some of those fortifications, each built with a specific purpose at hand.Hathi Haud: It means an elephant tanker in the literal sense. With a length of about 47.75 m, a width of 46.75 m, and a depth of about 6.61 m, it has the capacity to hold some cubic centimetres of water at once. It was meant for the gigantic elephants of rulers from different dynasties to feed on.Bharat Mata temple: with a measurement of about 87.14 m EW and 72.80 m NS direction, it holds two openings, one to the east and the other towards the northern end. Apart from the temple, there are several other religious contractions made that depict the probable ruler’s religious faith.Chand Minar: It was Constructed by Sultan Ala-ud-din-Bahmanim during 1447 AD, its height is 70 m, and the circumference at the base stands at 21 m. The unique part of this structure is its three different circular balconies.Andheri: in literal terms, it stands as the world of the blind. Similar was its significance in the fort. It was a meandering dark passage used as a way of defense by the then rulers to protect themselves from the enemies. The structure is something that most historical structures hold, but it is uniquely placed in the Daulatabad fort.Baradari: it was built in 1636 AD, with a capacity of 13 halls. During the Yadava dynasty reign, the Baradari was the palace of the queen. Later, during Shah Jahan’s invasion, he resided in that palace.Placed all across the premises of the fort, visitors and tourists often look for these sites on their tour of the fort. Such fortifications are true examples of the architectural and designing skills that people in those days possessed. They stand as inspirational structures for many construction field experts.ConclusionTracing back to history and comparing the scenario with the present times, there is more value addition in the history. Similarly, The Daulatabad Fort is one such structure that dates back to some grand historical value addition. Though such sites are nothing more than tourist locations presently, they would always contribute to the rich culture and heritage that prevails in India.Though, the valuation of the historic property has never been considered in terms of the economy. But it might stand at a sum of about some hundreds or thousands of crores of rupees. Nevertheless, the property valuation might have not been done, but in terms of adding to the Indian economy, it makes its count in the most remarkable of tourist sites spread across India.You Might Also LikeJaipur the Enthralling CityA Rich Historic Landmark of the Maratha Empire: Raigad FortThe worth of Mysore Palace might surprise you!Popular places to visit in PuneIndian realty sector to witness addition of 200 million sq. ft. this yearFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)","url": "https://www.squareyards.com/blog/daulatabad-fort-indias-priceless-possession-and-its-significance","thumbnailUrl": "https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/daulatabad-fort-825x510.jpg","image": ["https://www.squareyards.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/daulatabad-fort-825x510.jpg"],"datePublished": "July 16, 2021","dateModified": "July 16, 2021","author": {"@type": "Person","name": "Awadh Properties"},"publisher": {"@type": "Organization","name": "Samarjeet Chauhan","logo": {"@type": "ImageObject","url": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3627d95df82238dac2baa77774a028a7?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}},"description": "India, with its rich heritage and culture, is home to some of the majestic historical structures.
